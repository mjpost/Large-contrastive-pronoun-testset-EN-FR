My conscience is so immaculately clean that I fear I nitpick in trying to search my soul for any immoral acts I may have committed.

If the Thebans hadn't welcomed us as they did, we wouldn't be here this evening.
They could have captured us and handed us over to The Thirty Tyrants Who would have condemned us to death.
You're right, I still don't understand why the Thebans first allied With the Spartans to defeat us and then gave us exile after the ruin.

I must contest the gossips that for twenty years now have insisted in confusing me with a certain Socrates Who is busy analysing The mysteries of the earth, or, even worse, of venerating clouds.
Such a person is just in the spirit of those who have maliciously put me on stage
An atheist and Aristophanes or those who imitate him, do not at all hide the severity of the their accusations behind their prank.

Meletus's accusation is based only on defamation, this defamation can bring my death, but before you I will not behave like a coward.

The Czar, like Bismarck in Germany, knew what the international Money Changers were up to and had steadfastly refused to let them set up a central bank in Russia.
If America survived and was able to remain out of their clutches, his position would remain secure.

McGeer had obtained evidence deleted from the public record, provided to him by Secret Service agents, from the trial of John Wilkes Booth, after Booth's death.
McGeer said it showed that Booth was a mercenary working for the international bankers.

According to the congressional record, here is how it read in part:
These depressions could be controlled because America was on the gold standard.

But what if these revolutionaries get out of control and try to seize power from the super rich?
After all, it was Mao Tse Tung who in 1938 stated his position concerning power: "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun."
The Wall Street/London axis elected to take the risk.

It is not a coincidence that the biographies of all the Wall Street giants of that era, John D. Rockefeller, J.P. Morgan, Bernard Beruch etc.
all marvelled that they got out of the stock market just before the crash and put all their assets in cash or gold.
On October 24th, 1929, the big NY bankers called in their 24-hour broker call loans.

But it was new to Guernsey, and it worked miracles.
This market is still in use, and remember, it was built for no debt to the people of this island state. But what if we follow Guernsey's example?
How would the bankers react to these reforms?

As Milton Friedman has repeatedly pointed out, no severe depression can occur without a severe contraction of money.
In our system, only the Fed, the BIS, with U.S. bankers cooperation or a combination of the largest Wall Street banks could cause a depression.
In other words, our economy is so huge and resilient a depression just can't happen by accident.

Most of the founding fathers realized the potential dangers of banking, and feared bankers' accumulation of wealth and power.

He ended up staying for the next 18 years, nearly until the start of the American Revolution.
During this period, the American colonies began to issue their own money.

By the time the first shots were fired in Lexington, Massachusetts on April 19, 1775 the colonies had been drained of gold and silver coin by British taxation.
As result, the Continental government had no choice but to print its own paper money to finance the war.
At the start of the Revolution, the U.S. money supply stood at $12 million.

People were clamouring for a return to the Greenback money system of President Lincoln, or a return to silver money anything that would make money more plentiful.
That year, Congress created the United States Silver Commission to study the problem.
Their report clearly blamed the monetary contraction on the National Bankers.

Harding was an ardent foe of both bolshevism and the League of Nations.
His election, which opened a 12 year run of republican presidents in the White House, lead to an unprecedented era of prosperity known as the "roaring twenties".
Despite the fact that the war had brought America a debt ten times larger than its civil war debt, still the American economy surged.

And keep in mind, a stock market crash itself cannot cause a severe depression.
Only the severe contraction of our money supply can cause a severe depression.
The stock market crash of 1929 only wiped out market speculators, mostly the small and the medium ones, resulting in $3 billion in wealth changing hands.

Its aim is to spread radioactive material through a conventional explosion.
But almost all studies of such a possible weapon have concluded that the radiation spread in this way would not kill anybody because the radioactive material would be so dispersed and, providing the area was cleaned promptly, the long-term effects would be negligible.

A small group formed that began to shape America's response to the attacks.
At its heart were Donald Rumsfeld and Paul Wolfowitz, along with the vice-president, Dick Cheney and Ric Perle, who was a senior advisor to the Pentagon.
The last time these men had been in power together was 20 years before, under President Reagan.

What is new is the way the American and other governments have transformed this complex and disparate threat into a simplistic fantasy of an organised web of uniquely powerful terrorists who may strike anywhere and at any moment.
But no one questioned this fantasy because, increasingly, it was serving the interests of so many people.
For the press, television, and hundreds of terrorism experts, the fact that it seemed so like fiction made it irresistible to their audiences.

It's impossible, and so what ends up happening is the government short-circuits all the processes that are designed to distinguish the innot from the guilty because they simply don't fit this mode of locking people up for what they might do in the future.
The supporters of the precautionary principle argue that this loss of rights is the price that society has to pay when faced by the unique and terrifying threat of the Al Qaeda network.
But, as this series has shown, the idea of a hidden, organised web of terror is largely a fantasy and by embracing the precautionary principle, the politicians have become trapped in a vicious circle:

Wow!
Volcanoes, the oceans, the atmosphere.
But this week it's ice.
The polar ice even creates its own climate.
The air is so cold that it holds almost no moisture so, in fact, Antarctica is the biggest and driest desert on Earth.
But beneath the ice is another even more magical world, one that's been lost for more than 1 0 million years.

The ice moved fast, at first by 1 0%, then by 2002, 30-40% and it produced more water, like this river. And this water is probably the explanation why the ice here starts to move faster.
Each summer, as a result of rising temperatures, more and more melt water is forming lakes and rivers on the surface of the ice.
And this is where all the water flows, into deep shafts called moulins.

Water is heavier than ice so it will push itself under the ice and lift up the entire ice sheet.
So this water here dives down to the bottom of the ice sheet, lifts it up, lubricates it and allows it to move really fast?
If we have a water column that goes all the way down.

It is obvious, the profound influence these traditionalized structures have in shaping our understandings and perspectives.
Yet, of all the social institutions, we are born into, directed by and conditioned upon, there seems to be no system as taken for granted, and misunderstood, as the monetary system.
Taking on nearly religious proportions, the established monetary institution exists as one of the most unquestioned forms of faith there is.

We, economic hit men, really have been the ones responsible for creating this first truly global empire and we work many different ways.
But perhaps the most common is that we will identify a country that has resources our corporations covet, like oil, and then, arrange a huge loan to that country from the World Bank or one of it's sister organizations.
But the money never actually goes to the country.

In 2007, the Department of Defense received 161.8 billion dollars for the so-called global war on terrorism.
According to the national counter-terrorism center, in 2004 roughly 2000 people were killed internationally due to supposed terrorist acts.
Of that number, 70 were American.

Using this number as a general average, which is extremely generous, it is interesting to note that twice as many people die from peanut allergies a year than from terrorist acts.
Concurrently, the leading cause of death in America is coronary heart disease, killing roughly 450,000 each year.
And in 2007, the government's allocation of funds for research on this issue was about three billion dollars.

A green roof is a sustainable building technique and it's really simply soil and living plants, but it has some really amazing properties, such as storm water management.
It actually retains about between 70-95% of the water that falls on it. Energy conservation, it provides an insulating layer to the floor underneath it, they protect the roof from sun damage so they actually last up to five times longer than a traditional roof.

It's generating power, but the obelisk itself is putting the power into the atmosphere, making it useable.
And this is similar to Christopher Dunn's theory of the Giza power plant because he believes that the Great Pyramid was actually sending a microwave beam to a satellite that was in orbit around the planet.

While the real estate market has put Lehman Brothers shares under pressure, mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stocks are suddenly plummeting this morning after reports the companies may need to raise $75 billion just to remain solvent.

Making homes using hammers and nails and wood with the state of our technology today, is really absurd and will go the way of our labor class in regards to manufacturing in the United States.
Recently, there was a study by economist David Autor of MIT that states that our middle class is obsolete and being replaced by automation.
Quite simply, Mechanization is more productive efficient and sustainable than human labor in virtually every sector of the economy today.

The reason that people are interested in automating construction is that it really brings a lot of benefits.

Hence, the lesser manslaughter conviction.
No mention of Evans being the primary suspect in the disappearance and presumed death of the five young women was ever made at his manslaughter trial.
Five years ago, Evans was one of the most wanted men in state history, having emerged as the prime suspect in the disappearance of five young women.
Evans was eventually apprehended for the crimes, only to escape and elude authorities for several months, until the night he was arrested for the fatal barroom brawl that would lead to his manslaughter conviction.
The evidence necessary to try Evans for the abduction of the five young women proved illusory.

What's more, the Earth is warming more at night than in daytime, and more in winter than in summer.
