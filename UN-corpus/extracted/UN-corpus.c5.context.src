addressed to the Secretary-General
I am writing to you concerning the letter dated 19 December 1994 addressed to you by the Permanent Representative of Croatia to the United Nations (A/49/797), and, upon instructions of my Government, I have the honour to put forward the following positions of the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
The letter of the Permanent Representative of Croatia contains a series of untruths, false allegations and tendentious interpretations, which portray the Government of Croatia as not being interested in pursuing a peaceful and constructive resolution of the conflicts in the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia but instead as continuing a policy of confrontation against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the demonization of the Serb people as a whole.
The statement put forward by the Croatian representative that "the Security Council on numerous occasions recognized the military involvement of the 'Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro)' in Croatia by, inter alia, linking the sanctions regime imposed against the 'Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro)', to the situation in the areas under Serb control in Croatia" is absolutely untrue and is a cardinal example of a false interpretation of the facts.
The sanctions regime that has been unjustly imposed against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and in particular Security Council resolutions 757 (1992) of 30 May 1992, 787 (1992) of 16 November 1992 and 820 (1993) of 17 April 1993, have strictly been connected solely to the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Since 4 August 1994, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia severed all political and economic links with the Bosnian Serb leadership, apart from humanitarian assistance in food, 95-00237 (E) 050195 /... clothing and medicine.
The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia considers that the political status of the Krajina region, which is under the protection of the United Nations, should be resolved through negotiations between the parties on the basis of the Vance plan.
The present attempt by the Croatian authorities to define the status of Krajina contrary to the Vance plan, which Croatia itself has accepted, can only take us further from the attainment of the only possible solution, a political one.
The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, for its part, has invested efforts towards a political and negotiated solution to the conflict.

The attempt by the Permanent Representative of Croatia to present as a total fabrication the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's concerns about the forced conversion of Serb children to the Catholic faith in the Republic of Croatia is outrageous and a prime example of bigotry.
According to the data presented in the Sabor (Parliament) of the Republic of Croatia, about 10,000 Orthodox children have been converted to Catholicism.
Most of the clergy of the Serbian Orthodox church have been expelled from Croatia, including five of its bishops.

The Government, in its reply dated 7 October 2013, stated that these alleged cases form part of a political plot against the People's Democratic Republic of Korea by the authorities in the Republic of Korea.
The Government therefore "categorically rejects the cases ... as one of the anti-DPRK attempts". Discussion
The allegations in this case basically comprise arrests without warrants; indefinite interrogation periods in the premises of the National Security Agency; incommunicado detention; prosecution based on political considerations, including as an act of reprisal for leaving the country, or on the basis of vague offences that are general and imprecise; a total absence of judicial mechanisms to challenge the legality of the detention or to launch an appeal against the decisions of conviction; and indefinite detention in political prison camps, often following completion of a prison sentence.
In view of these serious allegations, the Working Group considers that the communication from the Government, which does not address any of these violations of international law relating to the arrest, detention, judgment, sentencing and appeal procedures concerning persons deprived of their liberty, is unlikely to facilitate any constructive dialogue.
As the Government has not provided any information about the situation of the petitioners, the Working Group, according to its methods of work, has to rely exclusively on the information provided by the source concerning the detention of the petitioners.

Reports also suggest that women have been subjected to sexual exploitation, rape, forced abortion and killing.
In at least four camps, the majority of prisoners reportedly remain in custody until their death.
Over the past few decades, it is estimated that at least 400,000 prisoners have perished in the camps."
The Working Group further takes note of the attention drawn by the Special Rapporteur to the particularly worrying practice, widely documented by the United Nations, of detention due to guilt by association, so that when a person is punished for a political or ideological crime, members of his or her family are also punished.
Up to three generations of family members of detainees are sent on this basis to the camps in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

Having received no response from the Government, the mandate holders issued a press release in February 2013 calling for an international inquiry into the human rights abuses in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which would shed light on the country's extensive political prison camp system.
The Working Group takes note of the recently established commission of inquiry on human rights in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, mandated by the Human Rights Council in resolution 22/13 to investigate the systematic, widespread and grave reports of violations of human rights in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, with a view to ensuring full accountability, in particular for violations which could amount to crimes against humanity.
Among the violations to be investigated are those pertaining to the right to food, those associated with prison camps, torture and inhuman treatment, arbitrary detention, discrimination, freedom of expression, the right to life, freedom of movement and enforced disappearances, including in the form of abduction of nationals of other States.
In a statement made to the Third Committee of the sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly on 29 October 2013, the Chair noted that the "final conclusions and recommendations [of the commission of inquiry] must await the end of the investigation.
However, the entire body of evidence gathered so far points to what appear to be large-scale patterns of systematic and gross human rights violations".

The mandate of MINURSO was extended until 31 May 1995, with the possibility of a further extension on the basis of a further report by the Secretary-General at that time.
The Government of Spain had forwarded important archival documents to the Acting Special Representative, at his request.
Those documents had been classified by MINURSO and were proving of considerable value as aids to identification, especially for doubtful cases.

As had been agreed, it could only take place when two tribal leaders (sheikhs), one from each side, were present to testify.
The representatives of the two parties and an observer of OAU were also expected to attend.
Problems arose when one of the parties had difficulties in making its sheikh available on time.
Moreover, both sides' earlier insistence on strict reciprocity meant that whenever, for whatever reason, identification could not take place at a centre on one side, work was automatically suspended at a centre on the other.

Morocco opposed the view that the 1973 election of sheikhs under Spanish rule was the only one ever held in the Territory, that sheikhs were traditionally coopted and not elected, that not all Saharan sheikhs were necessarily in the Territory in 1973 and that those elected in 1973 might subsequently have been replaced by others, since their term of office was to last only five years.
18. A measure of convergence then began to emerge.
On 10 February, the Acting Special Representative submitted a detailed proposal to the two parties: a surviving sheikh from the 1973 election was to be preferred; then his eldest surviving son; then a candidate from the election of 1973, normally by descending number of votes received; and failing that, the party would put forward three names from which the Chairman of the Identification Commission would select one, after consultation with the other party.
The three names were to be of persons from the subfraction concerned, of recognized standing in their community, of appropriate age, without any official position and themselves included in the census lists of 1974.
Attached to the proposal was a list of all 88 tribal subfractions included in the 1974 census and such information as was available to MINURSO concerning the sheikhs, sons of sheikhs and non-elected candidates from the 1973 election; in the 29 cases where no such person was known, a blank space was left for the three names to be provided by the parties.

The three names were to be of persons from the subfraction concerned, of recognized standing in their community, of appropriate age, without any official position and themselves included in the census lists of 1974.
Attached to the proposal was a list of all 88 tribal subfractions included in the 1974 census and such information as was available to MINURSO concerning the sheikhs, sons of sheikhs and non-elected candidates from the 1973 election; in the 29 cases where no such person was known, a blank space was left for the three names to be provided by the parties.

23. In late April, the Acting Special Representative held a series of consultations with the parties to address their concerns.
Both sides agreed to his proposals and, as a result, the identification operation was resumed at all eight centres on 2 May.
During the period since the Secretary-General's previous report, 7/ the parties had not entirely abandoned their insistence on reciprocity in the operation of the centres on both sides, or their attachment to a maximum of 150 persons to be identified daily at any given centre.
After additional resources had been made available since the adoption of Security Council resolution 973 (1995), MINURSO had been able on occasions to identify 800 to 900 persons in one day, which confirmed that a rate of 1,000 a day was technically feasible.
24. While noting the difficulties encountered as a result of the complexity and sensitivity of the identification process, the Secretary-General pointed out that during the 10 months since the start of the identification, barriers that had seemed insurmountable had been overcome and much had been achieved that now seemed irreversible.

The practice could continue of calling on two sheikhs from the tribal subgroup concerned, but these would not invariably be drawn one from each side, as had been the practice hitherto.
Were identification to take place without the participation of sheikhs from the Frente POLISARIO side, it would be necessary, for the process to have credibility, to insist on the submission of documentary evidence to establish that the individual was indeed a child of a Saharan father and some supporting evidence as to the father's birth in the Territory.
The Frente POLISARIO would, of course, be invited to observe the proceedings and to submit its observations in accordance with the agreed procedures.
OAU should also be represented and the presence of its observers would be an important element.
If such a programme could be implemented, the identification of persons living outside as well as those from the camps and the Territory could be completed in approximately four months.

Ms. Duschner (Canada), speaking in explanation of position on behalf of the CANZ group said that the group had called for the convening of the Phase V Working Group on reimbursement of contingent-owned equipment in early 2000, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 49/233 A and its own view that there was a need to review rates of reimbursement and to address issues that arose as the Organization gained experience of the reformed procedures.
She noted that the Committee had been informed by the Finance Management and Support Service of the Field Administration and Logistics Division that it would be ready to commence initial planning in mid-June with a view to convening the Working Group in the spring of 2000, subject to a decision by the General Assembly.
That time-frame had been endorsed by the Advisory Committee.
She therefore looked forward to the early convening of the Working Group.

He urged the Secretariat to make the necessary arrangements for the convening of the Phase V Working Group in early 2000, and requested that it should submit a comprehensive report on phase V in order to facilitate the Committee’s consideration of the issue.
The timing of the convening of the Phase V Working Group would be determined by a decision of the General Assembly, not on the basis of requests by individual Member States.
The activities of the Working Group must be subject to scrutiny by the Committee, as a subsidiary organ of the General Assembly, and by the competent expert bodies, including the Advisory Committee and the Board of Auditors.

33. Mr. Sulaiman (Syrian Arab Republic) said that his delegation hoped that the Committee would not allow a decision on the item to remain outstanding because, while it attached great importance to the work of the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS), it believed that that work required definition.
In that connection he recalled his delegation’s statement of position in the general debate on the item (A/C.5/53/SR.17, paras. 9–13).
34. Mr. Stein (Germany), speaking on behalf of the European Union, said that the Union regretted that the review of OIOS called for in General Assembly resolution 48/218 B had not been finalized, but hoped that the conceptual differences between delegations would soon be reconciled.
35. Mr. Darwish (Egypt) expressed his delegation’s regret at the lack of consensus on agenda item 145.
The role of OIOS in assisting the Secretary-General in managing the Organization’s human and financial resources so as to achieve optimum utilization and better performance was an extremely important one.

37. Mr. Jaremczuk (Poland) said that his delegation aligned itself with the statement made by the representative of Germany on behalf of the European Union.
38. Mr. Sulaiman (Syrian Arab Republic) reported that delegations had come close to reaching full agreement in informal consultations, with many paragraphs of a draft resolution adopted on a preliminary basis.
However, disagreement had been expressed at the last moment and it had therefore been impossible to reach a consensus.
Further consideration of the item should therefore be deferred to the fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly.
39. The Chairman suggested that in the light of the statement just made the Committee should recommend to the General Assembly that it should defer consideration of the item to the main part of its fifty-fourth session.

That attempt had not been helpful to the work of the Committee.
42. She hoped that a different spirit would prevail in future: imposing linkages that held some items hostage to the satisfaction of demands which related to other items under discussion should be foreign to the spirit and to the work of the Fifth Committee.
Rather, items should be judged on their own merits, and in a spirit of respect and cooperation.
43. She expressed the hope that the new Bureau of the Committee, now that it was aware of the possibility of such “hostage” situations, would do its utmost to avoid any recurrence at the fifty-fourth session.
44. Mr. Moktefi (Algeria) agreed that linking approval of proposals under discussion to matters external to them set a poor precedent.

Car parking at Headquarters
48. Mr. Niwa (Assistant Secretary-General for Central Support Services) said that he was perplexed by the complaint made by the representative of Syria at a previous meeting about non-diplomatic cars taking parking spaces reserved for diplomats.
He accepted that parking space had been limited because of construction work, but his staff were reporting only one or two violations per day of the parking restrictions.
Violators were fined $10.
He recalled that some Permanent Missions had opted not to use diplomatic plates but were nevertheless entitled to park in the restricted area.
49. Mr. Sulaiman (Syrian Arab Republic) said that even taking vehicles of Missions that did not use diplomatic plates into account, he believed that parking space for diplomats whose presence was required for meetings at Headquarters was being taken over by more than just one or two violators per day: the number was closer to four or five.
Given that there was space for so few vehicles because of the ongoing construction work, space must be reserved for persons with a bona fide need to attend a meeting at Headquarters and not just for persons accredited to Missions.

He had inspected the South Lounge with a view to opening it up as a replacement but after seeking other opinions had decided that the South Lounge was too small, and was also unsuitable because of the proximity of the press and United Nations television camera for the Security Council stakeout.
The hours of the Viennese Café in the first basement had been extended to compensate, and for the Security Council coffee was being provided in the “quiet room” adjacent to the Council Chamber.

The World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) prompted the redefinition of work within the secretariat, focusing on all three dimensions of sustainability, namely, environmental, economic and social.
This resulted in distinct shifts in modes of work within UNECE, encouraging genuinely cross-sectoral initiatives.
A primary example is the work between the Committee for Trade, Industry and Enterprise Development (CTIED) and the UNECE committees on timber and on environmental policy to promote trade in sustainably managed forest products (one such project is described in the following section on "Improved Trade Logistics for the Sustainable Use of Biomass").
This initiative has stimulated greatly enhanced collaboration between UNECE and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), as well as with the Trade Division of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the Committee on Trade and Environment of the World Trade Organization (WTO).

Enhancement of the reputation of companies involved and of the forest industry as a whole;
Elimination of illegal logging;
Widespread environmental and social benefits.
The development of timber certification answers the growing demand for "green" products, which has led to the drawing up of a new generation of international standards, generic environmental management standards (ISO 14000 series) and many national and regional environmental standards, guidelines and certification schemes.
The purpose of this type of "eco" certification scheme is to reward producers who meet the consumer demand for environmentally friendly products by allowing them to increase sales, create new market niches or charge a price premium for such products.

Many economies in transition are confronted with major challenges in the economic development of their forest resources.
Russia, in particular, faces problems in promoting the sustainable development of what could be one of its principal renewable export products.
The Trade Development and Timber Division has therefore launched the project, "Improved Trade Logistics for the Sustainable Use of Biomass", through which efficient trade networks for the export of biomass from the Russian Federation to European countries will be developed.
Assistance in the field of trade logistics will be provided to facilitate biomass trade flows between the participating countries.
An extensive network of private and public partners has already been established through the UNECE Trade Development and Timber Division project, "Capacity Building to Improve Trade Finance and Investment Prospects for the Russian Timber Sector". The Division's new biomass project will build on these existing contacts.

Background
In recent years, the need for a new focus on the UN Layout Key (UNLK) has increased.
Indeed, the growing use of advanced logistic concepts in global trade requires that developing countries and transition economies align their trade documentation to international standards if they want to participate in global trade.
In addition, it has become necessary to integrate paper trade documents into the electronic information interchange systems that are now available to trade such as UN/EDIFACT (the United Nations Electronic Data Interchange for Administration, Commerce and Transport), XML (Extensible Markup Language) and the Internet.
The UNECE has therefore launched the United Nations electronic trade Documents (UNeDocs) project. The purpose of the project is to develop and implement solutions for efficient trade document systems based on international trade standards and technologies that are accessible to traders from SMEs and developing countries.

This paper document is very complex and has a dual function:
Description and monitoring of the transit process through the countries involved;
Transmission of the information required by the various Customs offices of the transit entities.
Because of this dual function, the automation of the TIR carnet requires that the transit process first be recorded and described in a systematic and detailed way, using modelling techniques. This will lay the foundations for the long-term automation of transit procedures.
The tools developed by the United Nations Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business (UN/CEFACT) with the Unified Modelling Methodology are fully appropriate and support this objective.

Letter dated 16 January 1999 from the Minister for Foreign Affairs
The last tragic event in Reçak of Kosova, the atrocious massacre against ethnic Albanian civilians, urges me to write to You and express the deepest concern of the Government of Albania.
In a moment when the International Community is looking and calling for an urgent and peaceful solution of the conflict in Kosova, when the international relief organisations are trying to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe, the last genocidal act proves that there is no willingness to cooperate from the Belgrade regime.
This cruelty is only the latest one in the chain of Serb carnages.

This cruelty is only the latest one in the chain of Serb carnages.
It cannot be an incident, but a well planned and executed policy of scorched land and ethnic cleansing.
The Reçak massacre constitutes at the same time a provocation to the international organisations and especially to the United Nations which are already involved in finding out a peaceful solution to the conflict.

The Chairperson reminded Committee members that the question of the establishment of a working group on working methods had been raised at the previous session in connection with the outcome of the ninth Inter-Committee Meeting.
Time constraints had precluded an in-depth discussion of the matter at the time.
Mr. Thelin said that the two key issues, in his opinion, both concerned backlogs.
More than 400 communications were currently pending and the Committee dealt with only 90 cases on average each year.
Citizens of States parties would be entitled to perceive delayed justice as a denial of justice.

Citizens of States parties would be entitled to perceive delayed justice as a denial of justice.
Another issue that might be discussed was the interrelationship with other treaty bodies and the universal periodic review mechanism.
Mr. O'Flaherty said that he fully agreed with Mr. Thelin on the areas in which reform was required.
The Committee's working methods had been constantly evolving since its establishment, so the need for continuing reform was beyond dispute.
The point to be decided was what kind of mechanism would prove most efficient in delivering the requisite improvements.
He enquired, for instance, about the procedure for selecting the members of a working group.

It was important to ensure that its proposals would be acceptable to the Committee as a whole.
Another challenge was the establishment of appropriate terms of reference, prioritization of activities and access to resources.

It was unclear whether the working group would meet during the Committee's regular sessions and whether it would require interpretation services, in which case plenary meeting time would be forfeited.

It was important to ensure that any work on the interrelationship with other treaty bodies was consistent with the existing inter-committee process.
He was also curious about the relationship between a working group on working methods and the Bureau of the Committee, which had proved quite efficient to date in identifying areas in which reforms were required.
Mr. Lallah asked how the proposed new working group would differ from those established in the past on various aspects of the Committee's working methods, such as communications and follow-up to concluding observations.
How many working groups would there be?
With regard to harmonization, the Committee already appointed representatives to attend inter-committee meetings.

It might be helpful to review the evolution of working methods over the past 10 or 15 years.
Mr. Pérez Sánchez-Cerro agreed with Mr. Thelin that two 5-member chambers were needed to deal with communications instead of the existing 10-member Working Group.

Mr. Pérez Sánchez-Cerro agreed with Mr. Thelin that two 5-member chambers were needed to deal with communications instead of the existing 10-member Working Group.
He suggested that States parties should not be required to respond in writing to the list of issues.
The delegation could present the replies orally during its dialogue with the Committee.
That would solve the perennial problem of translation of documents into all working languages.
For instance, the periodic report of the Russian Federation consisted of some 9,000 words but the replies to the list of issues amounted to some 33,000 words.

He suggested that the Committee should discuss the possibility of drafting a substantiated petition for an amendment to the Covenant increasing its membership from 18 to 27 in order to deal with the backlog in communications and State party reports.
As Mr. Thelin had said, justice delayed was justice denied.
Mr. Salvioli said that 18 members were, in his view, sufficient.
In any case, the Covenant could be amended only by the States parties.

Had the same information been provided in a series of oral replies, it would have proved quite overwhelming.
Where States parties cooperated by providing such detailed replies, it was important to ensure that translated versions of the documents were available.
She agreed with Mr. O'Flaherty that a great deal would depend on the resources available to a working group.
If resources were scarce, it would be more efficient to have single rapporteurs with a specific mandate working together with members of the secretariat.
Mr. Rivas Posada said that there was little point in listing the shortcomings in the Committee's work.

Mr. Amor emphasized that the Committee's current debate was focused on its working methods, within the pre-established framework of the Covenant.
Some of the Committee's current working methods were satisfactory, while weaknesses could be identified in others.

Taking one of many possible examples, he cited the pre-sessional working group on communications, whose work at times did very little to assist the plenary, since even members of the working group sometimes called into question the validity of the draft texts the group had produced.
In those cases, the pre-sessional work of the working group wasted time and money.

If the Committee agreed that there was a need to review its working methods, he proposed that it could begin with the list of issues Mr. Thelin had raised to decide whether there was room for improvement and whether further issues should be added to the list.
As to who should undertake the review, a single rapporteur was a possibility and all the Committee members had relevant experience and ideas that were worthy of examination.
However, a joint effort would be welcome, maybe in the form of a group of Committee members, old and new.
The Bureau already had a heavy workload and should not be further burdened.

It was important to be aware that the treaty bodies appeared to be losing credibility with States parties, which were entering increasing numbers of reservations to the treaties, taking less heed of committees' recommendations and demonstrating an almost distrustful attitude.

There was no need to introduce more bureaucracy or complicate matters, but it was necessary to consolidate ideas on what changes were needed, within the framework of the Covenant.
Sir Nigel Rodley agreed with Mr. O'Flaherty that the Committee was constantly reviewing its working methods in order to meet the exigencies of new situations.
He had misgivings about establishing a standing working group that would be permanently charged with reviewing working methods.
If the proposal was not to establish such a standing group, the Committee needed to have a clearer idea about what specific issues the group would be set up to review.
He failed to understand why the review of working methods should be carried out by a working group.
Since some tasks were better carried out by a rapporteur, some by the plenary and others by working groups, it would be useful to clarify why any particular issue required a group and how the group would be composed.
In the past, individual colleagues and groups of colleagues had identified areas for improvement in working methods and had produced discussion papers, which had successfully translated into revised working methods.
Depending on the issues that were identified, the plenary might best proceed either on the basis of a report, by merely taking note of an issue, or on the basis of a study by a group of Committee members, always with the input of the secretariat.

He proposed that a working paper should be drawn up in order to clarify the current discussion.
Mr. Lallah recalled that during the first years of its existence, the Committee had had a working group composed of five members to deal with all matters.
Thereafter, two working groups had been established, one to handle communications, the other to examine any issues which the plenary entrusted to it.

Thereafter, two working groups had been established, one to handle communications, the other to examine any issues which the plenary entrusted to it.
Over time, only one working group had remained, with more than five members, and it had subsequently disappeared, either through a lack of resources or lack of mandate.
The Committee had always faced the problem of a backlog of reports, and the amount of time it took to consider reports was a constant challenge.
The Committee should guard against reversing its past achievements.
In order to tackle the problem of State party reports, and since consideration of reports sometimes lasted four meetings, the previous working group had introduced the idea of lists of issues in order to achieve a more focused approach.
Without written replies, the examination of a State party report would take an inordinate amount of meeting time.

There was no need for a general working group to sit at every session, or for it to be composed of the same Committee members over time.
He suggested that the Committee consider re-establishing the second working group, bearing in mind that there were some issues which were better examined by a single rapporteur.
The Chairperson said he understood that, prior to the introduction of the task force system, a working group had been responsible for drawing up lists of issues.
When the task force system had been adopted, that working group had disappeared, enabling the working group on communications to have 10 members.

Mr. Thelin said that he did not envisage a permanent working group on working methods, but rather an ad hoc group which would take stock of the situation and prepare a position paper.
His current thinking was that the Bureau might appoint five people who would present a paper no later than July 2010, which would take into consideration the current discussion, including the possibility of re-establishing the working group on working methods.
Given that it would be a relatively open-ended mandate, there was no need to establish the terms of reference.
Mr. O'Flaherty, welcoming the clarification provided by Mr. Thelin, considered that a working group on working methods was unnecessary.

If a working group were tasked only with identifying areas for reform, it would tell the Committee nothing new; if, on the other hand, it were requested to suggest potential solutions, it would be exceeding the mandate that such a group should have.

If the Committee adopted an approach based on lists of issues prior to reporting, the former working group on lists of issues might need to be resurrected.

Mr. Salvioli said that, in view of the confused nature of the discussion, he was not in a position to take any decision.
The Chairperson said that he and the other members of the Bureau were constantly endeavouring to improve the Committee's working methods.
The difficulty lay in how to proceed, given the complexity of reform.
In particular, the Committee should reach agreement on whether to adopt an approach based on lists of issues prior to reporting before its future working methods could be determined.

First, a State party's initial report must continue to be submitted in full.
Second, both the Committee and the State party concerned must agree to follow the proposed new approach for any given report.

Would distinctions be made depending on how many reports a State party had already submitted?
He endorsed Ms. Keller's comment that the name of the process should reflect the status of the documents to be prepared by States parties.
Possible options included "reports based on lists of issues" or "focused reports".
The Committee should also consider what would happen in the event that a State party fell behind in its reporting obligations or failed to reply to a list of issues for some years.
Further to Mr. Thelin's comment on paragraph 17, he said that the paragraph should state when the new process came into effect.

With regard to the proposed new approach to reporting, he pointed out that the issue had been discussed some years previously, in response to calls by States parties to simplify the reporting process, and that a similar solution had been proposed.
The Committee should examine whether the measures then suggested were still viable.

He recalled that one of the triggers for first exploring the option of a new reporting system had been the burden that producing reports placed on States parties.
He had been informed by representatives of some large States with powerful civil services that they felt great sympathy with the challenge that smaller States must face in compiling the reports required by various treaty bodies.
Reports also placed a burden on the resources of the secretariat.
He had recently attended a meeting between the Bureau and the secretariat at which problems relating to documentation, editing and translation had been discussed.
Only certain specific types of document were mandated for translation, and those that were not could not be assigned higher priority.
Furthermore, whether translations were mandated or not, they all had to be produced on the basis of existing resources, of which too much was already being demanded.

He asked Ms. Keller to confirm his understanding that, under the new reporting system, there would be two types of list of issues: one would always be prepared in advance of the State party's appearance before the Committee, as at present; the other would be used in advance of certain periodic reports as an indication of what the Committee expected the State party to report on, in order to relieve the reporting burden and focus the subsequent discussion.
The latter list would not restrict either the Committee or the State party, both of which could still raise any other matters under the Covenant.
The text of the draft also gave both the State party and the Committee the right to insist on the use of a full report rather than the new approach.
In his view, an important issue that remained to be decided was the stage at which the new reporting system should come into effect.

The Chairperson provided more information on the meeting between the Bureau and the secretariat referred to by Sir Nigel Rodley.
A number of recent translation problems had been discussed at that meeting, including one very serious problem where a State party's written replies had been substantially longer than its report and Conference Services had been unable to provide those replies in the working languages in good time.
Part of the problem had been that written replies, unlike reports, were not a mandated document and therefore could not be given any special priority.
Under the new approach, the State party's report would consist of replies to a list of issues from the Committee, which would make it possible to avoid similar problems in the future.
Mr. Rivas Posada asked for clarification on why the use of the new reporting system was set out explicitly as being voluntary for the State party.

If criteria were applied to determine whether it was appropriate for a State party to report using the new approach, what would those criteria be?

Mr. O'Flaherty said that he generally supported the initiative of the new reporting approach.
He still had two main concerns: Committee members must reserve the right to raise any question they wished under the Covenant when a State party presented its report, without being restricted by what had been included on a list of issues; and the new approach should be adopted for a specified pilot period, perhaps three or four years, to enable it to be evaluated.
Ms. Keller, responding to members' concerns and questions, said that it was important to maintain flexibility in the reporting system in view of article 40, which stipulated only that States parties should prepare initial and periodic reports, and not that those reports should comply with the format which the Committee requested.
The new approach could therefore be used only with the consent of both sides.

Mr. Lallah concurred with Ms. Keller that the criteria for using the new reporting approach should not appear in the reporting guidelines, but felt that it was nonetheless important to establish those criteria before any major decision was taken on the matter.
In his view, the new method should be used after the initial report of a State party.

Following the successful completion of the Energy Security Forum activities in 2006, the Committee on Sustainable Energy launched an expert intergovernmental dialogue on energy security directly during its 2007 annual session.
The International Energy Agency and the Energy Charter have actively taken part in this energy security dialogue.
During 2007, the International Energy Agency and the Energy Charter began cooperating on preparations for a conference with UNECE held in during the Energy Efficiency 21 Project Steering Committee session in May 2008 on International Cooperation on Energy Efficiency: Working Together on a Low Carbon Economy.
6. Each intergovernmental body, expert group and technical assistance project provides a form of external oversight and evaluation for UNECE activities.
However, in the sustainable energy field, external evaluation is more extensive and pronounced than for some of the other Sectoral Committees because of the large extrabudgetary financial resources this programme attracts.

A number of the activities of the Committee on Sustainable Energy that are supported largely by extrabudgetary resources have maintained operations for 10 to 15 years, notably in the fields of natural gas and energy efficiency.
During the 2006-2007 biennium, external evaluation reports were issued for activities funded by UNDP, the United Nations Development Account and the United Nations Foundation/United Nations Fund for International Partnerships.
7. In addition to the oversight of expert groups and external advisers, work programme elements and projects can be evaluated by a variety of "objective" means including user surveys and analyses of Internet usage patterns for dedicated project websites or pages.
For example, the Energy Efficiency 21 Project webmaster undertook an external evaluation of the Project by an Internet based survey of EE21 participants documented in a report on the EE21 Website Survey.
The survey illustrates how a small but representative sample of EE21 participants view the project and its activities, in particular which activities and facilities of the website are valued most.

The self-evaluation of the CAPACT project showed that the deployment of clean coal technology in Central Asian countries could benefit from a model law on energy efficiency which could be adopted by national governments in the region in order for participating countries to implement a regional energy efficiency and conservation programme .
IV. Overall Assessment
9. The legislative reviews, financial reporting, accounting of final outputs, external evaluations and internal self-evaluations by the secretariat show that the Committee on Sustainable Energy attracted record levels of interest, commitment and support for its programme of work in 2006-2007.
Both the 2006 and 2007 annual sessions of the Committee were attended by over 220 participants from some 40 UNECE countries and six countries outside the UNECE region, as well as by some 20 international organizations.
Both the 2006 and 2007 Committee sessions comprised decision-makers to a significant degree, with over half the participants at the Director level or above within their government ministry, company, international organization or non-governmental organization.

The report states that "the patient's psychological suffering is consistent with the testimony described and with the logic of abuse, painting a sinister picture, both in the present as in the future, since her emotional balance and interpersonal relations have been affected (she virtually communicates only with her daughter).

The patient is in despair and socially withdrawn, needs constant company and is incapable of attending to her own needs without help. This indicates a significant deterioration in the most important areas of a person's life".
The report also states that "any statement given under the conditions described in the patient's account must be considered tainted, owing to its origin".
2.6 In November 1997, on the recommendation of Dr. A.C.A., the author was admitted to the Zaldibar Psychiatric Hospital, where the medical team confirmed the previous diagnosis.
This was set out in a report sent by Dr. D.A.T., a psychiatrist at the hospital, to the National High Court in December 1997, in connection with the proceedings against the author.
When asked by the Court what had triggered off the chronic post-traumatic stress disorder from which the author was suffering, the report responded that it was "being detained and living in fear for her physical safety".

This was set out in a report sent by Dr. D.A.T., a psychiatrist at the hospital, to the National High Court in December 1997, in connection with the proceedings against the author.
When asked by the Court what had triggered off the chronic post-traumatic stress disorder from which the author was suffering, the report responded that it was "being detained and living in fear for her physical safety".
In answer to the question whether there was any medical reason that might explain why the author had not made known to the legal authorities the ill-treatment that she claimed to have suffered, the report said that "the very pathology unleashed by the incident may be a sufficient reason to explain why she did not report the incident at the outset".

2.7 In the ruling 27 January 1998, the author was acquitted by the National High Court of the crime of collaborating with an armed group, with which she had been charged.
According to the ruling, the Court "does not consider the charge brought by the Public Prosecution Service to be justified on the basis of the police statement alone, taking into account the psychological state of the author at the time of making the statement, in the light of the evidence given by experts in the oral trial".
The judgement also showed that, prior to her detention, the author had lived a normal life and worked on a drug addiction project for Arrigorriaga local council.

This report states that the author "suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder incidental to having undergone inhuman and degrading treatment, which included physical and psychological violence, during police detention in 1996.
In spite of the passage of time, the disorder is still present and active in all its manifestations".
The report also states that the author "did not suffer from any psychiatric disorder or personality deviation prior to the detention by the police, which may be related to the disorder exhibited post-detention".

In his legal statement, Dr. G.P.L. fully stood by his report.
Three other doctors who had treated the author made statements and the reports mentioned above were submitted to the court.
In July 2002, the author requested that the doctor who had treated her in Zaldibar hospital should be required to make a statement. Although she was the only psychiatrist to have treated the author, she had not been called; and the same applied to the primary care physician and the psychologist who monitored her.
However, this request was not granted.

2.11 On 26 August 2002, investigating judge No. 28 of Madrid issued an order to close the case.
The order stated that there was no objective information to support the claim that the author had suffered ill-treatment during the hours in which she was detained at Civil Guard headquarters under the authority of the National High Court; that none of the three lawyers who had assisted her during her detention had observed any signs of physical ill-treatment, nor had she told them anything about it; and that there was not objective information confirming that such ill-treatment had occurred. It was therefore impossible to establish a causal link with the author's illness.
2.12 The author lodged an application for reconsideration with subsidiary appeal against the order, maintaining that the psychiatric reports were consistent with her statement and were thus prima facie evidence with sufficient substance to continue with proceedings.

The application for reconsideration was rejected on 11 October 2002.
On 21 May 2003, the Madrid Provincial High Court dismissed her appeal and confirmed the decision.
The Court considered that the author's statement and the forensic medical reports did not prove that the ill-treatment that was the subject of her case had taken place.
The author points out that the proceedings before the examining court did not require proof to be adduced that she had suffered ill-treatment, since the Criminal Procedure Act requires only the existence of sufficient prima facie evidence to move on to oral proceedings.

The complaint
3.1 The author states that the events described constitute a violation of article 10, paragraph 1, of the Covenant, in that she was tortured while held in incommunicado detention on 7, 8 and 9 June 1996.
3.1 The author states that the events described constitute a violation of article 10, paragraph 1, of the Covenant, in that she was tortured while held in incommunicado detention on 7, 8 and 9 June 1996.
She maintains that if she had not been put into incommunicado detention, the Civil Guard officers would not have acted with the degree of impunity that they did and the events described could have been avoided.
Restricting a detainee's right to be assisted by a trusted counsel, which entails the possibility of a private meeting, or at least communicating to the detainee's family that there is such a possibility, creates a sense of depression in the detainee and impunity in the police officers concerned, and gives rise to situations with extremely serious consequences, as in the present case.
In this connection, the author recalls the recommendations by the Committee and the special rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment that Spain should abolish incommunicado detention.
3.2 The author states that the Spanish courts prevented a fair trial on the acts of torture.

Even disregarding her appeal and its dismissal, decisions on inadmissibility should, under article 35 of the Convention, be based on the Court's evaluation of the merits ("the appeal is incompatible, with the provisions of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, manifestly ill-founded or an abuse of the right of application").
The rejection of an appeal on the grounds that it is manifestly ill-founded concerns not the mere external formalities or the observance of procedural rites but the material substantiation of a claim.
Rejection implies a review by the same court and such a review means that the same issue cannot be brought before the Committee.
This is the case envisaged in rule 96 (e) of the Committee's rules of procedure.
4.2 With regard to the author's request that the Committee should order the State party to redress the damage suffered and declare the regime of incommunicado detention incompatible with the Covenant, domestic remedies have not been exhausted.

Also, it states that none of the lawyers who assisted the author during the course of her detention observed any signs of physical ill-treatment and she herself did not report this, "when it seems logical, in the circumstances, that the victim would have made the ill-treatment known to her lawyer and the investigating judge before whom she appeared; when questioned on the way that she had been treated, she responded only that she had not been hit".

5.3 In its ruling rejecting the appeal, the Madrid Provincial Court concluded that "there is no evidence to suggest a logical and chronological connection between the particular situation alleged to have taken place on or around 14 June 1996 and the medical assistance provided later at the detention centre where the complainant was admitted, because the prison medical services were not informed until 18 June 1996 of the anxiety suffered on the first date, 14 June 1996, although it came to light as a result of her detention".

With regard to the application for amparo, the Constitutional Court concluded that, in view of the many medical inquiries that had been undertaken, it was not convinced by the arguments put forward by the author regarding the relevance of the evidence that she requested, so it was not included in the Court's final judicial decision.
5.4 Meanwhile, the application to the European Court of Human Rights was deemed inadmissible by the decision of a committee of three judges.

5.4 Meanwhile, the application to the European Court of Human Rights was deemed inadmissible by the decision of a committee of three judges.
This does not represent an unthinking or superficial decision but was made on the basis of a thorough examination of the facts.
The letter informing the author of the decision states that the Court "does not observe any appearance of violation of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention or its Protocols".
Furthermore, although the case before the European Court ended on 13 May 2008, the author did not apply to the Committee until November 2009.
This, added to the time that has passed since the decision of the Constitutional Court (almost five years) and the fact that the author waited almost three years to report the alleged ill-treatment to the domestic courts, calls into question the seriousness and substance of the present communication.
5.5 The author was arrested and placed in incommunicado detention for a period of just over 72 hours, after which she was detained in prison.
This does not represent an unthinking or superficial decision but was made on the basis of a thorough examination of the facts.
The letter informing the author of the decision states that the Court "does not observe any appearance of violation of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention or its Protocols".
Furthermore, although the case before the European Court ended on 13 May 2008, the author did not apply to the Committee until November 2009.
This, added to the time that has passed since the decision of the Constitutional Court (almost five years) and the fact that the author waited almost three years to report the alleged ill-treatment to the domestic courts, calls into question the seriousness and substance of the present communication.
5.5 The author was arrested and placed in incommunicado detention for a period of just over 72 hours, after which she was detained in prison.
From the perspective of article 7 of the Covenant, what is relevant is whether the medical condition observed during detention and pretrial detention over almost 15 months is a normal (although undesirable and unfortunate) consequence of this experience or whether it is the result of having been subjected to ill-treatment.
The cause of the disorder was not determined clearly in the course of the legal investigation, despite the fact that numerous medical tests were conducted.
Neither is new information included in the present communication that might lead to an alternative conclusion.
While some of the medical reports lend credibility to the author's version, others contradict it, or at least, indicate that other possibilities cannot be ruled out.
Thus a report by Dr. E.F.R., a psychiatrist at the forensic medical clinic of the Ministry of Justice, produced at the request of investigating judge No. 28, notes that "a causal link between the allegation and the psychologically traumatic experience in question cannot be established, as the information provided by the informant is unsupported by objective data and we are unable to ascertain the truthfulness of this account. ... This post-traumatic stress may be due to multiple life stress factors and this expert cannot, in the light of the available diagnoses, categorically confirm which of them could trigger the alleged post-traumatic stress disorder. ...

Detention alone could, in the circumstances and without the need for any ill-treatment, followed by imprisonment, lead to an adaptive disorder exhibiting elements of post-traumatic stress disorder in which her detention, followed by imprisonment, could have acted as life stress factors.
5.6 The claim of torture was submitted almost three years after the events allegedly took place, which objectively makes it difficult to effectively investigate.
Nevertheless, the investigation identified all the Civil Guard officers who had had contact with the author. They were questioned; witness statements were taken from all the court-appointed lawyers who had had contact with the author during her detention, and from the forensic doctors who had examined her; and numerous medical reports on the author's state of health were included in the proceedings.
These investigations served to prove the existence of a post-traumatic stress disorder.
However, all the action taken, such as the taking of statements from independent lawyers who had assisted the author and from the forensic doctor, did not provide any circumstantial evidence that could justify the continuation of criminal proceedings with the opening of an oral trial.

Although the theory that the author's disorders were a consequence of her detention and pretrial detention was acknowledged, there is reason to think that they are a consequence of the author's procedural situation and her arraignment on a serious criminal charge and not related to irregularities in her detention and pretrial detention.

It reiterates that the author did not attempt to obtain any form of indemnification before the Spanish courts, in spite of the fact that the law provides for a specific procedure for cases of persons held in pretrial detention and later acquitted.

There is an impartial system of material responsibility in place, which also includes compensation for moral damage and in which it is not necessary to prove that ill-treatment or torture has occurred.
Therefore, the author's claim that it is not possible to obtain indemnification without the prior conviction of those responsible for torture is unfounded.

5.8 With regard to the author's complain relating to the incommunicado detention regime, the State party maintains that it is inappropriate to examine, on the basis of an individual communication, a complaint aimed at prompting an abstract, general consideration of whether a domestic legal rule is compatible with the Covenant.
Moreover, incommunicado detention, which is regulated by articles 520 bis and 527 of the Criminal Procedure Act, in line with article 10, paragraph 1, of the Covenant.
Such detention may be imposed only in specific cases and in a restrictive manner.
Its application requires legal authorization in all instances on the basis of a substantiated and reasoned decision, which must be issued in the first 24 hours of detention. It also requires constant and direct monitoring of the detainee's personal situation by the judge who approved the detention, or the investigating judge of the judicial district where the detainee is being held.

The only differences from the regular detention regime are: (a) a lawyer is appointed by the court; (b) detainees do not at any time have the right to let family members or anyone else know the reason for their detention or where they are being held in custody; (c) detainees do not have the right to a private interview with the court-appointed lawyer on the conclusion of the inquiry in which they have participated; and (d) the maximum period of detention (72 hours) may be extended by the judge.

The question of duration is not significant in the case of the author, since she was arrested on 7 June and had been brought before a court by 11 June.

Her mental state did not allow her to make the great effort required to lodge a complaint.

The report also states that "she did not suffer from any psychiatric disorder or personality deviation prior to the police detention that could have had a bearing on the state she exhibited following her detention".
The author categorically rejects the statement in the order that her psychological suffering is due simply to her detention.

6.3 With regard to the application to the European Court of Human Rights, the author states that she filed the application on 11 June 2005 and that the Court took more than three years to reach a decision.
The fact that it took just over a year to bring her case before the Committee after she had been notified of the Court's decision was due to the scepticism she felt following the repeated negative decisions obtained up until that point.
6.4 The author points out that all the psychiatrists who have examined her have drawn the same conclusions.
The report that the State refers to in order to claim that there was not such unanimity was produced by Dr. E.F.R., who never treated or examined her.
The author categorically rejects the statement in the order that her psychological suffering is due simply to her detention.

With regard to the statements given by the police officers who are alleged to have been taken to court, they refused, in the one appearance before investigating judge No. 28, to answer the questions of the defence counsel, and the prosecution service did not even question them.
The prosecution service did not participate in any of the inquiries carried out at the examination stage while the proceedings were going on.

6.5 With regard to the claim for damages, the author says that, if it is recognized that she was tortured, the only way of minimally repairing the harm she has suffered is to pay compensation.
Free, specialized medical assistance would also be of great help.
She says that she is open to whatever compensation is considered to be appropriate.
6.6 Regarding the compensation procedure referred to by the State, set out in article 294 of the Judiciary Organization Act, the Act requires proof that the offence with which an individual was charged was not committed.
However, it is generally impossible to prove a negative, which makes acquittal practically unfeasible.

Consideration of admissibility
7.1 Before considering any claim contained in a communication, the Human Rights Committee must decide, in accordance with rule 93 of its rules of procedure, whether the communication is admissible under the Optional Protocol to the Covenant.
7.2 The Committee observes that the author presented an application on the same events before the European Court of Human Rights.
In a letter dated 13 May 2008, the author was informed that a committee of three judges had decided to declare the action inadmissible, since it did not observe any apparent violation of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention or its Protocols.
The Committee recalls that, in ratifying the Optional Protocol, Spain introduced a reservation excluding the competence of the Committee in relation to cases that have been or are being examined under another procedure of international investigation or settlement.

7.3 The Committee recalls its case law relating to article 5, paragraph 2 (a) of the Optional Protocol to the effect that, when the European Court bases a declaration of inadmissibility not solely on procedural grounds but also on reasons that include a certain consideration of the merits of the case, then the same matter should be deemed to have been "examined" within the meaning of the respective reservations to article 5, paragraph 2 (a), of the Optional Protocol; and it must be considered that the European Court has gone well beyond the examination of the purely formal criteria of admissibility when it declares a case inadmissible because "it does not reveal any violation of the rights and freedoms established in the Convention or its Protocols".
However, in the particular circumstances of this case, the limited reasoning contained in the succinct terms of the Court's letter does not allow the Committee to assume that the examination included sufficient consideration of the merits in accordance with the information provided to the Committee by both the author and the State party.
Consequently, the Committee considers that there is no obstacle to its examining the present communication under article 5, paragraph 2 (a), of the Optional Protocol.

8.3 The Committee recalls its general comments No. 20 (1992) and 21 (1992) regarding the relationship between articles 7 and 10, paragraph 1, of the Covenant and considers that the facts alleged by the author, fall within the scope of application of article 7, read independently and in conjunction with article 2, paragraph 3, of the Covenant.
The Committee will therefore examine the facts from that perspective and not under article 10, paragraph 1, which is invoked by the author.

In the face of this evidence, the State party puts its weight behind the report of the psychiatrist from the forensic medical clinic of the Ministry of Justice, produced at the request of investigating judge No. 28, in which he claimed that he could not categorically establish the origin of the disorder solely on the basis of the medical reports referred to above. However, in the Committee's opinion, this report, a copy of which was provided by the author in the framework of the present communication and which was issued without the author having been examined by the doctor concerned, does not constitute sufficient grounds for refuting the medical reports based on the examination and direct treatment of the author. Moreover, it cannot serve to support the conclusion that events did not occur in the way the author describes.
The report also maintains that the absence of objective information makes it impossible to establish a causal link between the author's disorder and the events that she describes.
This prompts the Committee to address the issue of the investigation of the author's complaint by domestic courts.
8.5 The Committee observes that, in the course of the investigation by investigating judge No. 28, the Civil Guard officers who had dealt with the author, the court-appointed lawyers provided by the State during her incommunicado detention and the forensic medical examiner who examined her at that time were identified and questioned.
However, the author claims that the Civil Guard officers, in the sole appearance that they made before a judge, refused to answer questions from the private prosecutor.

In the face of this evidence, the State party puts its weight behind the report of the psychiatrist from the forensic medical clinic of the Ministry of Justice, produced at the request of investigating judge No. 28, in which he claimed that he could not categorically establish the origin of the disorder solely on the basis of the medical reports referred to above. However, in the Committee's opinion, this report, a copy of which was provided by the author in the framework of the present communication and which was issued without the author having been examined by the doctor concerned, does not constitute sufficient grounds for refuting the medical reports based on the examination and direct treatment of the author. Moreover, it cannot serve to support the conclusion that events did not occur in the way the author describes.
The report also maintains that the absence of objective information makes it impossible to establish a causal link between the author's disorder and the events that she describes.
This prompts the Committee to address the issue of the investigation of the author's complaint by domestic courts.

As for the court-appointed lawyers and the forensic medical examiners, who stated that the author had not complained of ill-treatment, the Committee considers that the reasons given by the author for not informing them of the treatment to which she had been subjected are convincing, especially bearing in mind the vulnerable position in which she found herself as a result of the incommunicado regime.

The Committee also observes that, during the course of the author's trial in the National High Court, the author reported the ill-treatment she had suffered while held incommunicado, but no ex officio investigation was carried out.
8.6 The Committee recalls its general comments No. 20 (1992), and No. 31 (2004) as well as its settled jurisprudence, according to which complaints alleging a violation of article 7 must be investigated promptly, thoroughly and impartially by the competent authorities and appropriate action must be taken against those found guilty.

In the present case, the Committee considers that the closure of the case at the examination stage, which prevented the holding of the oral trial does not meet the requirements or thoroughness that should be applied to all reports of acts of torture, and that the only inquiries conducted at the examination stage were not sufficient to examine the facts with the rigour required by the severity of the author's illness and the reports of the doctors who treated and diagnosed her.
Given the difficulty of proving the existence of torture and ill-treatment when these do not leave physical marks, as in the case of the author, the investigation of such acts should be exhaustive.

Furthermore, all physical or psychological damage inflicted on a person in detention -- and particularly under the incommunicado regime -- gives rise to an important presumption of fact, since the burden of proof must not rest on the presumed victim.

Appendix
We are unable to agree with the admissibility decision rendered by the Committee in this case for the following reasons.
The Committee has recognized that "even limited consideration of the merits" of a case constitutes an examination within the meaning of the respective reservation.
The matter is considered to be the same if the contents of the European Convention, as interpreted by the European Court of Human Rights, are sufficiently proximate to the protection afforded under the Covenant.
We see no reason to depart from this long-standing interpretation in the case before us.
The European Court based its inadmissibility decision on the argument that it did not find "any appearance of violation of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention and its Protocols."
We fail to see how this could be interpreted other than as an even limited consideration of the merits.

We fail to see how this could be interpreted other than as an even limited consideration of the merits.
Indeed, the Committee has found in previous cases that the European Court should be considered as having gone beyond the examination of purely procedural admissibility criteria when declaring an application inadmissible on these grounds.
The author of the communication had the choice between submitting this case either to the European Court of Human Rights or to the Human Rights Committee.

It is not for the Human Rights Committee to assess whether the examination of a case has been sufficiently careful under a procedure which enforces a norm affording an equivalent level of protection to that provided by article 7 of the Covenant, and which was invoked unsuccessfully by the author of a communication before the matter was brought to the Committee.

It would have been important, however, if the Committee would have highlighted the particular circumstances of the case in more detail. This would have made it clear that the Committee would only deviate from its general respect for reservations such as made by Spain and a substantial number of other European countries and Uganda in exceptional circumstances.

This would have made it clear that the Committee would only deviate from its general respect for reservations such as made by Spain and a substantial number of other European countries and Uganda in exceptional circumstances.
2. The Spanish reservation to article 5, paragraph 2 (a), implies that the Committee is barred from the examination of a communication from an individual unless it has ascertained that the same matter has not been or is not being examined under another procedure of international investigation or settlement, in this case the European Court of Human Rights.

In the present case there is no dispute about the question of whether the communication before the Committee relates to the same matter as the complaint before the European Court of Human Rights.
The main question is whether the European Court of Human Rights had indeed "examined" the case so as to give the reservation its preclusionary effect for purposes of article 5, paragraph 2 (a).

That brings us to the particular circumstances of the present case. The Committee has noted the limited reasoning contained in succinct terms in the letter of the European Court of Human Rights to the author in which she was informed that the Court had declared her application inadmissible since the Court did not observe any apparent violation of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the (European) Convention or its Protocols.
Unfortunately, the Committee leaves it at that and does not further elaborate on the peculiar circumstances of the case.

4. The Committee could have added that in this particular case the letter had been sent by the European Court of Human Rights to the author almost three years after she had submitted her application to the Court without her application having been sent to the State party for its submissions on the admissibility or merits of the case.
The Committee could further have noted that in this particular case the author had lodged her application to the European Court of Human Rights alleging a breach of article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (prohibition of torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment) which is similar to article 7 of the Covenant.

In such cases where the physical integrity, yes indeed the right to life, of the individual complainant has been at stake, it should be clear from the record of the (inadmissibility) decision of the European Court of Human Rights that the Court has sufficiently given attention to the merits of the case in order to constitute an examination for purposes of the preclusionary effect of a reservation, like the Spanish one, to article 5, paragraph 2 (a), of the Optional Protocol.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS
31. The activities of the Working Group on Environmental Monitoring supported by the Tacis funds helped to improve the visibility of environmental monitoring and observation units in the Environment Ministries in EECCA countries.
Networks of monitoring experts are being established in individual EECCA countries following the demandrequests from UNECE to designate experts for participation in specific project components.
On the other handMoreover, in view of the data collection and other preparations for the Kiev Assessment report within WGEMthe Working Group, non-EECCA countries have been recognizing the need to support efforts to strengthen EECCA monitoring and observation capacities and to integrate them into mainjor international networks, in particular those that are developed by EEA.
32. The Environment Ministers in Kiev supported the Working Group in its activities, particularly on strengthening environmental information and observation capacity in the 12 countries of Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia.

7. Tokelau's experiences in recent referendums had shown that the people of the Territory must understand the different options available to them in the exercise of their right to self-determination and how autonomy would be sustained if they were to choose it.
The leadership of Tokelau must be united and must provide educational programmes to raise public awareness on political development in relation to self-determination.
8. Ms. Cavanagh (New Zealand) said that Tokelau continued to face a number of challenges posed by its geographic isolation, skill shortages, small population and limited resources.
Transport had dominated New Zealand's engagement with Tokelau over the previous two years.
The recent launch of a two-year shipping charter service between Apia and Tokelau marked a significant step forward in New Zealand's efforts to secure safe, reliable and efficient transport for the Territory.

Moreover, the Governor had informed the citizenry that the British Chief Financial Officer would remain in place irrespective of the election outcome while the Territory's 260-million-dollar loan guarantee was in force, claiming that the Turks and Caicos Government -- a Government installed by the administering Power -- had agreed to that condition.
That unconstitutional and disingenuous condition must be revoked at once, and the Special Committee must act to prevent other such perversions of justice, lest Turks and Caicos citizens be reduced to second-class citizens in their native land.
16. By processing the applications for Belonger status filed by a large number of expatriates who had lived in the Turks and Caicos for many years, the administering Power had in effect expanded the franchise in the Territory despite the citizenry's strong opposition to the initial recommendation.
In addition, members of the British Armed Forces, almost none of whom were citizens of the islands, were allowed to vote in local elections.
Taken together with the stringent requirement that Turks and Caicos citizens living abroad must reside in the Territory twelve out of twenty-four months in order to be able to vote and did not have the option of absentee balloting that was available to United Kingdom citizens resident abroad, the measures constituted a gross violation of the indigenous citizen's right to vote.

18. Mr. Thomson (Fiji), introducing the draft resolution on the issue on behalf of his country and Papua New Guinea, read out a technical correction to the text.
Operative paragraph 21 should be changed to reflect that the high-level Ministerial Mission of the Melanesian Spearhead Group was to take place from 1 to 6 July 2012, not from 2 to 9 July 2012.
19. Draft resolution A/AC.109/2012/L.12 was adopted.
20. The Chair, after reviewing the work accomplished by the Special Committee during the past session, observed that the Committee would need to seek realistic ways of implementing its decolonization mandate on a case-by-case basis and with full recognition of the aspirations and interests of the peoples and Governments of the Non-Self-Governing Territories.
To that end, the Special Committee must remain engaged in the process of decolonization with the active participation of the United Nations system and the Territories themselves, and with enhanced cooperation from the administering Powers.

At around 8.30 that day, one of the vehicles belonging to the Mission of Côte d'Ivoire was towed away by a police officer from 129th Street, in Manhattan, even though it was properly parked as were all the other vehicles on that same street.
The chauffeur of the Mission went shortly thereafter to the marshal's office on 40th Street to find out why the vehicle had been towed, and was handed a note (see appendix) which stated that the vehicle in question had been removed because it had accumulated a number of unpaid parking tickets.
The Permanent Mission of Côte d'Ivoire immediately contacted the Office of Foreign Missions of the United States Mission; the latter did not secure the vehicle's release until about 4 in the afternoon.
The Permanent Mission of Côte d'Ivoire would like to point out that, as far as it knows, the new measures envisaged by New York City are not scheduled to come into effect until 1 April.
Moreover, these measures do not include the towing away of vehicles as penalty for unpaid parking tickets.

In fact, the document concerning the new measures decided upon by New York City states quite clearly that, in the event of repeated violations of the parking laws, the owner of the vehicle would receive a notification from the Office of Foreign Missions informing him that he could no longer lawfully use his vehicle as long as the tickets remained unpaid.

(b) Triennial comprehensive policy review of operational activities for development of the United Nations system (continued) (A/62/73-E/2007/52, A/62/74-E/2007/54, A/62/211, A/62/253 and A/62/326)
1. Ms. Silveira (Uruguay), speaking on behalf of the Southern Common Market (MERCOSUR), said that it was important to further increase trade between countries of the South.
The MERCOSUR countries had expanded technical cooperation with other developing countries thereby playing an important role in strengthening the institutions of such countries for rapid and effective skills transfer.
2. The least developed countries and landlocked developing countries had most benefited from cooperation with MERCOSUR.
However, middle-income countries still accounted for nearly two thirds of the world's poor; South-South cooperation had great potential to reduce disparities between the rich and the poor within countries, and to eradicate hunger and poverty through skills transfer.

MERCOSUR was prepared to share its experience in national policymaking as well as provide technical and technological assistance to developing countries.
3. South-South cooperation supplemented the assistance committed by developed countries to developing countries.
Often, South-South cooperation flows were deducted from total assistance for lack of a universal definition of South-South cooperation, including its conditions, and means for measuring its effectiveness.
The South-South cooperation agenda had to be drawn up essentially by countries of the South.

5. The countries of the MERCOSUR welcomed Argentina's proposal to host a United Nations conference on South-South cooperation to review progress in the implementation of the Plan of Action in 2008.
6. Mr. Labbé (Chile) said that his delegation attached great importance to the triennial comprehensive policy review and trusted that all concerned parties would demonstrate goodwill and flexibility during the Committee's deliberations.
7. Developing countries had to be able to take advantage of new trends in technical cooperation.
While the adoption of the Buenos Aires Plan of Action for Promoting and Implementing Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries had been a great step forward, it was in urgent need of updating.

It was important for the Committee to consider the situation of middle-income countries, which continued to require active cooperation from developed countries in areas such as innovation, science, technology and worker specialization.
Middle-income countries often suffered from an unequal distribution of wealth, with a large proportion of poor people.

11. The unpredictability of core funding and uneven or non-existent burden-sharing among Member States made the Organization unduly vulnerable to short-term donor priorities, thus undermining the authority of the respective intergovernmental governing mechanisms.
Such a situation weakened the role of the Organization and jeopardized its legitimacy.
Switzerland therefore supported good multilateral donorship based on predictability and quality of funding, multi-year pledging, emphasis on core contributions, and agreements among Member States on burden-sharing.
Upper middle-income developing countries, particularly net contributors, would be welcome to participate in such initiatives.
12. The General Assembly should endorse the definition of capacity development proposed by the United Nations Development Group.

Regrettably, too many specialized agencies remained unable to plan their activities at field level on a multi-year basis. That seriously hindered the capacity of such agencies to be part of the United Nations Development Assistance Framework and to contribute effectively.
Specialized agencies should delegate more authority to their country representatives and use country-level multi-year programming.
15. General concerns related to environmental sustainability and the implementation of the Bali Strategic Plan for Technology Support and Capacity-building could be significantly alleviated by ensuring that United Nations Development Assistance Frameworks and Poverty Reduction Strategies adequately reflected needs as expressed by Governments, and that the resident coordinator and United Nations country team made full use of the Organization's capacities, particularly those of the United Nations Environment Programme, to respond to the needs of developing countries for Government capacity-building.
16. The resident coordinator could enhance system-wide coherence at the country level, and must be mandated to speak and act on behalf of the United Nations country team and to carry its messages to the highest levels of government.
Moreover, the resident coordinator must be given increased responsibility over the strategic positioning of the Organization, including the authority to allocate country-level resources to highest priority activities, and the responsibility to optimize the use of the technical capacity and expertise of the country team and across the regional centres of the Organization.

There was a need not only for adequate funding for such cooperation by the United Nations development entities and for triangular cooperation, but also for greater use of the experience and expertise of the South in the ongoing work of the United Nations development system.
Measures supporting South-South cooperation should be mainstreamed in programmes, country-level activities and country offices.
Developed countries' contributions were also important.
23. India supported the strengthening of the capacity of the United Nations development system for gender mainstreaming.
While advocacy in that area was important, there was an even greater need to support developing countries' efforts to promote gender equality and empower women.

Within the Organization itself, there was concern that the number of female staff at senior levels, especially in the Professional category, had significantly fallen, as had the number of female resident coordinators.
Furthermore, there had been a lack of analysis of female representation from developing countries, despite the emphasis on that issue in General Assembly resolution 59/250.

That would enable the United Nations system to better respond to the new demands of the United Nations agenda as well as to national plans and priorities.
29. The Department of Economic and Social Affairs should continue its efforts to build a comprehensive and sustainable financial data and reporting system.
There were important differences between the way the United Nations and the Development Assistance Committee of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development defined, classified and reported contributions to the United Nations system.
Her delegation therefore encouraged those organizations to continue to work together closely in that area.
Once their harmonization efforts had yielded results, the findings should be brought to the intergovernmental process for further deliberation and action, if necessary.

It was important for governments to have a common standard by which to assess levels of funding.
30. The increase in capital flows between developing countries indicated the new dynamism of those countries in the global market and a healthy growth in the economies of the more advanced developing countries.
However, the upward trend in South-South cooperation might be perceived as a replacement for ODA to developing countries.
More needed to be done to understand the nature and dynamics of South-South cooperation.
In particular, it was important to know whether the trade figures reflected an overall deepening and/or widening of economic relations among countries of the South or merely an increase in a few large items, such as trade in commodities and the transit of goods to the North.

Another question was how triangular cooperation could go beyond the present limited conceptual framework and meaningfully address the asymmetrical power relations between the developed and developing world.

Another question was how triangular cooperation could go beyond the present limited conceptual framework and meaningfully address the asymmetrical power relations between the developed and developing world.
31. It was also critical to ensure clarity in the conceptual framework underpinning South-South cooperation.
Organization and planning at the country level should be based on national development agendas and geared to achieving the Millennium Development Goals and any other agreed targets included in national strategies.
Financing should also be adequate and steady enough to be mobilized for development assistance purposes, although it was important at the same time to explore new financing mechanisms.
Lastly, in view of the complex nature of development operations, non-resident United Nations entities should be involved in directing the reform process, thereby making the most of the diversity of expertise within the Organization.
35. Ms. Gustava (Mozambique) said that the Committee should seize the opportunity offered by the triennial comprehensive policy review to explore the best ways to reform the work of the United Nations system and improve delivery of operational activities at the country level.

The funds, programmes and agencies within the United Nations development system needed to explore innovative approaches with a sense of urgency to improve the funding structure by increasing the share of core resources.
At the same time, efforts should be made to minimize the negative effects of non-core resources by strengthening coordination and planning and by making flexible use of the various policy coordination tools.
49. The reform of United Nations operational activities for development should enhance the ability of the United Nations to meet the needs of recipient countries in an integrated and flexible manner.
Such reform should safeguard the leadership and ownership of recipient countries and ensure the consent and participation of the recipient governments without any conditions or fixed models.
Moreover, savings from the reform should be reinvested in assistance programmes.

Norway welcomed the efforts being made by funds and programmes and by the specialized agencies in the Chief Executives Board for Coordination to facilitate cooperation and coherence at the country level.
The Board should continue harmonization of practices and removal of structural bottlenecks.
However, some issues required attention at the intergovernmental level.
Measures to address them should be discussed during the negotiations on the review.
The United Nations agencies should implement the recommendations of the 2004 review concerning the mainstreaming of gender equality.

The protection of the environment was also an integral component of sustainable development and should be recognized as such in the review.
57. Post-crisis conflict situations required concerted and rapid action.
The United Nations needed to develop a coherent and effective response framework in support of national efforts and in collaboration with partners.
Joint tool kits such as the Post-Conflict Needs Assessment were a welcome step forward, and the United Nations should consolidate its partnership with other actors such as the World Bank in that regard.
Further efforts were needed to clarify coordination, division of labour, leadership, sequencing and prioritization.

Specific funds must be allocated to support South-South cooperation, particularly technical and economic cooperation between developing countries.
However, South-South cooperation should not replace North-South cooperation, and should not affect the scarce resources currently allocated for operational activities.
62. Mr. Kumar (Nepal) said that operational activities for development should support local development priorities, with greater focus on local technical capacity-building.
Sustainable capacity-building activities were contingent on the strengthening of national ownership and leadership of development activities.
The resident coordinator system should be made more efficient and accountable.

Long-term operational efficiency, sustainability and productive capability could be achieved by investing in development infrastructure, strengthening economic institutions and establishing a viable technological base.
63. The United Nations development system could be instrumental in accelerating and broadening South-South cooperation, including through triangular cooperation.
A United Nations conference on South-South cooperation marking the thirtieth anniversary of the Buenos Aires Plan of Action would offer a good opportunity to expand the base of South-South cooperation.
64. Mr. Rees (United States of America) said that the United Nations should focus on capacity-building.
Bearing in mind the World Summit Outcome, the top priority should be to help countries build and consolidate democratic institutions to promote good governance as the foundation for development and to ensure aid effectiveness in the long run.

65. Members must strive for greater coordination in development activities.
Several countries had volunteered to work with the United Nations in undertaking "one-UN" national pilot programmes in line with the recommendations of the High-level Panel on System-wide Coherence.
Major stakeholders, including the countries themselves, the agencies involved, the United Nations Evaluation Group and the regional commissions should play important roles in a rigorous evaluation process.
The Committee's resolution on the review should focus on results so as to bring together the substance and process issues in a coherent development vision.
The resolution should be clear about the Organization's objectives and expected results.

It should also be clear that, in order for the agencies to be results-oriented, their resources should be linked to programme performance.
66. Ms. Mills (Jamaica) said that it was essential to properly assess the impact and effectiveness of the United Nations contribution to national development plans and strategies so as to enable developing countries to measure their own progress towards attaining national goals and objectives.
Capacity development could be facilitated through greater utilization of expertise at the national level, in keeping with the objective of ensuring national ownership and leadership.
Maintaining that focus would significantly increase the potential for reducing transaction costs.

68. The triennial comprehensive policy review should not be preceded or superseded by any other process unless so decided by the General Assembly.
The strategic planning cycles of United Nations funds and programmes should be fully aligned with the review cycle so as to avoid unnecessary complications in discussions by the respective governance structures.
There should be greater collaboration between the United Nations development system and the Peacebuilding Commission in order to ensure that long-term socio-economic recovery and development objectives of post-conflict countries were realized.
There should also be greater cooperation and coordination with the Bretton Woods institutions in the provision of development assistance, in accordance with the priorities of recipient countries.
Her delegation was concerned about the tendency for the United Nations system to adopt common approaches in its response to countries adversely affected by natural disasters or conflicts.

There should be no attempt to diminish the challenges faced by countries in those situations by taking the same approach in responding to very different circumstances.
69. Special attention should be given to coordination of the United Nations development system at the country level.
Jamaica was concerned about the potential for diluting the development focus of the assistance provided by United Nations funds, programmes and specialized agencies in favour of strengthening coordination mechanisms in the field.
Efforts aimed at achieving system-wide coherence should focus on how existing mechanisms could be improved and maximized so as to avoid unnecessary duplication and overlapping.
The United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) Guidelines and Common Country Assessments had proven particularly useful in enhancing cooperation and coordination on the ground.

The Committee's focus on the most disadvantaged and vulnerable countries should not detract from the fact that developing countries as a whole required the support and assistance of the entire United Nations development system.
The focus on socio-economic development should take into account the grave inequities that persisted among and within countries and regions.
71. Mr. Tarragô (Brazil) said that Brazil's experience was marked by a number of South-South cooperation initiatives in different fields, including agriculture, fiscal administration, combating HIV/AIDS, biofuels and sport, and in different regions.
That fruitful exchange of knowledge and experiences was favoured by Brazil's cultural, historical, geographical and political ties that had roots in many different countries.
72. At the bilateral level, Brazil's technical cooperation was designed to contribute to national goals and consisted in the sharing of experience and expertise through the provision of consultants and technicians, the promotion of training courses, the building of professional capacity and the donation of equipment.

Brazil wished to continue its fruitful cooperation with multilateral agencies in third countries in the implementation of joint projects.
In December 2004, Brazil and the World Bank had signed the first contract between an international financial institution and a developing country to co-finance a project in another developing country.
74. Lastly, the convening of a United Nations conference on South-South cooperation would boost international efforts to shape the boundaries and modalities of such cooperation.
In that regard, his delegation welcomed Argentina's offer to host such a conference.
75. Mr. Punkrasin (Thailand) said that operational activities for development of the United Nations system must respond to the development needs of developing countries in a flexible and coherent manner in accordance with their national development strategies and priorities.

It was sharing knowledge with the Government of Afghanistan, with a view to reducing opium poppy cultivation there.
Thailand had also strengthened its role as an emerging donor by setting up the Thailand- UNDP Country Partnership Programme for 2007-2011.
79. South-South cooperation must not replace North-South cooperation and assistance, or be limited to relationships among States.
The United Nations must promote not only cooperation among the South, but also real multilateralism, inclusive partnerships and well-coordinated action to harness resources in the South.
The United Nations must act as facilitator in establishing systematic transfers of technical and financial planning for emerging donors in the South.

It also had a key role to play in harmonizing and aligning development cooperation, in order to achieve accountability, coherence and maximum development results from old and new donors alike.
80. Mr. Mishkorudny (Belarus) said that United Nations operational activities for development were a key element in the reform of the Organization, since that reform affected the interests of all countries, particularly the programme countries.
His delegation favoured rational reforms capable of realistically enhancing the capacity of the Organization to meet the challenges ahead.
It also believed that the governments of the recipient countries should retain the leading role in the organization of United Nations programme activities in their countries.

81. It was advisable to take a balanced approach with regard to the introduction of uniform models of work at the country level.
For example, in such countries as Belarus, where there were a small number of United Nations agencies, a "small country team" made more sense than a "one country team".
At the same time, countries with economies in transition clearly needed completely different tools from those of the least developed countries.
82. Reform should not hinder the implementation of the fundamental objective of operational activities, namely development assistance.
The United Nations should provide assistance to programme countries for capacity-building in the fields of human rights and good governance only when requested to do so by those countries.

It was inadmissible to attempt to introduce discriminatory criteria against country recipients of international assistance based on evaluations of the effectiveness of their national economic policies, State governance and human rights systems.
83. His delegation underlined the importance of assistance to enhance energy security.
Given the increasing deficit of energy resources and the threat of climate change, UNDP and other United Nations agencies should provide programme countries with the assistance required to expand their access to alternative energy sources and new technologies in that area.
84. His delegation welcomed the adoption by consensus of the UNDP strategic plan for 2008-2011.
The decision of the UNDP Governing Council in that regard and the report of the Secretary-General on progress in the implementation of General Assembly resolution 59/250 provided a good basis for negotiations on a new resolution on the triennial comprehensive policy review of operational activities for development of the United Nations system.

In order to develop South-South cooperation, it would be necessary to make more systematic and consistent use of the United Nations system, especially UNDP.
The development of South-South cooperation should also be included in the regional, subregional and country programmes of UNDP.
87. Mr. Sul Kyung-hoon (Republic of Korea) said that the fact that the current triennial comprehensive policy review was taking place at the midway point between the adoption and the deadline for the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals made it particularly meaningful.
He was confident that the outcome of the review would reinvigorate efforts to realize those Goals.
88. While the increase in total funding for the United Nations system was welcome, the widening imbalance between core and non-core resources was a matter of concern.

93. Mr. Kim In Ryong (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) said that South-South cooperation enabled developing countries to strengthen solidarity among themselves and achieve sustainable development through self-reliance.
Efforts to promote such cooperation -- such as the strategies and action programmes announced at the Asian-African Summit 2005, the second South Summit and the fourteenth Non-Aligned Movement Summit -- would mitigate the adverse effects of the global economic environment and better equip developing countries to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.
94. Economic cooperation among developing countries had provided new impetus to international economic relations in recent years.
The United Nations should bolster developing countries' efforts to strengthen regional and interregional cooperation.
His delegation supported the recommendation by the High- level Committee on South-South Cooperation, at its fifteenth session, that a United Nations conference on South-South cooperation should be convened to commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of the Buenos Aires Plan of Action for Promoting and Implementing Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries.

98. UNIDO was committed to renewing its efforts to broker the effective cooperation between developing countries, including through the establishment of Centres for South-South Industrial Cooperation to stimulate the development of mutually beneficial partnerships between the industrially more advanced developing countries and the least developed countries.
99. The first such Centre, launched in India in February 2007, would focus on six key rural- and urban-oriented industrial areas and reinforce existing South-South cooperation between UNIDO and India.
The previous month, UNIDO and China had signed agreements on the establishment of a second Centre in Beijing and on the establishment in China of an international renewable energy centre to promote cooperation on hydropower, wind power and biomass technologies between China and sub-Saharan Africa in particular.
The Governments of China and India were providing significant funding to those Centres as part of their commitment to ensuring that the benefits of industrial growth were spread more widely.
Further Centres were envisaged in Brazil, Egypt and South Africa.

Highlighting two other areas of South-South cooperation that were important to his organization's mandate, he said that UNIDO was pleased to be a partner in the Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD), which played an important role in fostering cooperation between the countries of the South and between the North and the South.
UNIDO looked forward to playing an active role in TICAD IV in 2008.
101. The second area involved support to regional economic integration efforts.
One such initiative was his organization's quality promotion programme with the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU).

One such initiative was his organization's quality promotion programme with the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU).
The programme, which had received considerable financial support from the European Union, was based on the understanding that the developing world, particularly the least developed countries, would not benefit from globalization and trade liberalization unless they had competitive exportable products.
The relatively small size of WAEMU economies made it far more cost-effective to develop regional rather than national standards and accreditation systems.

This is the twenty-second report to the Governing Council of the United Nations Compensation Commission (the "Commission") submitted pursuant to article 38(e) of the Provisional Rules for Claims Procedure (S/AC.26/1992/10) (the "Rules") by the "D1" Panel of Commissioners (the "Panel"), being one of two Panels appointed to review individual claims for damages above 100,000 United States dollars (USD) (category "D" claims).
This special report contains the determinations and recommendations of the Panel in respect of three category "B" claims and 27 category "C" claims filed pursuant to Governing Council decision 12 (S/AC.26/1992/12), submitted to the Panel by the Executive Secretary of the Commission pursuant to article 32 of the Rules.
All 30 claims were submitted by the Government of Kuwait.

The Executive Secretary has referred these 30 claims to the Panel for review as the categories "B" and "C" claims processing programmes were completed in 1994 and 1999 respectively.
The three category "B" claims have been transferred to category "C" and reviewed in accordance with the category "C" methodologies, because they comprise claims for mental pain and anguish resulting from personal injury, a loss which does not fall within the scope of category "B" claims.
Therefore all 30 claims have been reviewed by the Panel in accordance with the applicable category "C" methodologies and compensation criteria.

Applicable evidentiary standard The evidentiary standard to be applied in reviewing category "C" claims is set out in Governing Council decision 1 (S/AC.26/1991/1), and more specifically in article 35 of the Rules.
Article 35(1) imposes the evidentiary requirement that:
"Each claimant is responsible for submitting documents and other evidence which demonstrate satisfactorily that a particular claim or group of claims is eligible for compensation pursuant to Security Council resolution 687 (1991).
Each panel will determine the admissibility, relevance, materiality and weight of any documents and other evidence submitted."
With respect to category "C" claims, article 35(2)(c) of the Rules provides that the claims must be documented by appropriate evidence of the circumstances and amount of the claimed loss.

With respect to category "C" claims, article 35(2)(c) of the Rules provides that the claims must be documented by appropriate evidence of the circumstances and amount of the claimed loss.
The claimants have not filed claims for the physical injury (although supporting documentation regarding the injuries has been provided in all cases), but rather for the associated mental pain and anguish suffered and, in three cases, loss of earnings due to an inability to work as a result of the injuries sustained.
The claimants sustained a wide range of injuries - from temporary injuries such as deep wounds to parts of the body for which the claimants successfully underwent treatment - to permanent injuries such as the complete loss of limbs or eyesight.
Nine claimants sustained temporary injuries only, 15 claimants sustained permanent injuries, and the remaining six claimants suffered both temporary and permanent injuries.
When reviewing the claims, the Panel has applied the category "C" methodologies and compensation criteria established by the "C" Panel in respect of "C2" claims for mental pain and anguish and in respect of "C6" claims for loss of earnings.
During the regular category "C" programme, claims for mental pain and anguish were subject to individual review, while those for loss of earnings were subject to the computerized application of a compensation formula.

Mental pain and anguish
In respect of the mental pain and anguish losses included in all 30 claims, the Panel has applied the approach taken by the "C" Panel in its report for the First Instalment of category "C" claims, in which it determined that once the fact of injury had been proven, the presence of mental pain and anguish could reasonably be assumed.
In its report for the Seventh Instalment of category "C" claims, the "C" Panel determined that a statement by the claimant mentioning or implying a causal link between Iraq's invasion and occupation of Kuwait and the injury, whether provided on the claim form or separately, created a presumption that the injury was attributable to Iraq.
The Panel notes the evidentiary standard for category "C" claims set out in article 35(2)(c) of the Rules (see paragraph 4 above).
The Panel finds that all 30 claimants have submitted sufficient documentary evidence to establish the fact of injury and the requisite causal link between the injury and Iraq's invasion and occupation of Kuwait, in the form of medical reports and photographs depicting the injuries sustained.

The Panel finds that all 30 claimants have submitted sufficient documentary evidence to establish the fact of injury and the requisite causal link between the injury and Iraq's invasion and occupation of Kuwait, in the form of medical reports and photographs depicting the injuries sustained.
There are three claims for loss of earnings due to an inability to work as a result of the injuries.
The Panel applies to these claims the principles adopted by the "C" Panel in its report for the Seventh Instalment of category "C" claims.
In this report, the "C" Panel determined that claims by gainfully employed persons whose ability to work had been permanently or temporarily affected by a disability or injury, could be classified as employment-related support claims, and that these claims should be reviewed in accordance with the "C6" loss of salary methodology.
The "C" Panel also included in the category of employment-related support claims, claims by persons who were not employed, but who, as a result of a permanent disability, might never be able to be fully employed.
The "C" Panel noted that employment-related claims comprised very different types of losses, often arose out of very different factual circumstances, and raised legal and valuation issues specifically relevant to the particular type of loss.

The "C" Panel noted that employment-related claims comprised very different types of losses, often arose out of very different factual circumstances, and raised legal and valuation issues specifically relevant to the particular type of loss.
Considering these losses to be among the most complex to be processed, the "C" Panel adopted a methodology entailing: (a) the review of sample claims, (b) the use of statistical data regarding the patterns of evidence and the amounts claimed, (c) a detailed study of employment-related legislation, international standards and factual information regarding employment practices in Iraq and Kuwait, and (d) the computerized application of a compensation formula based on all factors considered.
The compensation formula developed by the "C" Panel is based on the application of a multiplier of seven to the asserted monthly salary that the claimant was earning immediately before Iraq's invasion and occupation of Kuwait in order to determine the amount of compensation to be awarded.
The Panel has applied this compensation formula to the three claims that include a loss of earnings component.
The Panel accordingly recommends awards of compensation calculated in accordance with the compensation formula established by the "C" Panel and described in paragraph 12 above.
recommendations of the panel in respect of the claims The Panel finds that all 30 claims are compensable under the category "C" methodologies and compensation criteria and recommends awards of compensation as set out in the tables below.

4.2 On the exhaustion of domestic remedies, the State party does not submit that the author has failed to exhaust domestic remedies, in the light of the fact that the complainant exhausted all administrative remedies and that the complainant's request for legal aid was rejected, effectively barring him from pursuing judicial remedies before the Norwegian courts.
The State party refers to the Committee's jurisprudence regarding the exhaustion of judicial remedies in the absence of legal aid.
4.3 The State party submits that the existence of a consistent pattern of gross, flagrant or mass violations of human rights in a country does not as such constitute sufficient grounds for determining that a particular person would be at risk of being subjected to torture upon his or her return to that country, and recalls the Committee's jurisprudence in that regard.

In that regard, the State party reiterates the views adopted by the Norwegian Immigration Appeals Board as well as the Norwegian Immigration Authorities, that although the working conditions for journalists and other media representatives in Iran are poor, the complainant had not generated journalistic activities of a nature or scope that could be deemed to draw the continued attention of the authorities, and place him at personal and foreseeable risk.
The State party argues that the journalistic activities conducted by the complainant, even after his arrival in Norway, do not constitute the type of activities that would be subject to monitoring by the Iranian authorities, since the latter are primarily preoccupied with monitoring activities by Iranians in exile that may pose a concrete risk to the regime.

The verification of the documents was conducted by the Norwegian Embassy, and the verification report was submitted to the complainant through his counsel at the time, for comment.

5.2 The complainant also submits further documentation of his activities as a journalist both in the Islamic Republic of Iran and Norway, including Internet and newspaper articles that he had written on the subject of religion and politics in Iran, and signed by him using his real name.
The State party further informed the Committee that the complainant was registered with an address in Norway as from 20 November 2007, and was therefore no longer in hiding.

The Committee takes note that the complainant was denied legal aid by the Fylkesmannen in its decision dated 7 December 2006, and that this decision was confirmed following an administrative appeal to the Justissekretariatene, in its decision dated 26 January 2007.
The Committee considers that, in the light of the fact that the complainant would not be able to pursue judicial remedies without legal aid, the denial of free legal aid to the complainant effectively renders the possibility of judicial review unavailable, and that accordingly, the complainant must be considered to have exhausted all available domestic remedies.

Consideration of merits:
7.1 The Committee must determine whether the forced return of the complainant to the Islamic Republic of Iran would violate the State party's obligations under article 3, paragraph 1, of the Convention not to expel or return ("refouler") an individual to another State, where there are substantial grounds for believing that he or she would be in danger of being subjected to torture.
7.2 The Committee recalls its general comment No. 1 (1996) on the implementation of article 3 of the Convention, and its case law, which state that the risk of torture must be assessed on grounds that go beyond mere theory or suspicion.

Furthermore, in its general comment No. 1 the Committee states that it must also determine whether the complainant has engaged in political activity within or outside the State concerned that would appear to make him particularly vulnerable to the risk of being subjected to torture (para. 8 (e)).
The Committee also recalls that, while it gives considerable weight to the findings of fact of the State party's bodies, it is entitled under article 22, paragraph 4, of the Convention, to freely assess the facts of each case, based upon the full set of circumstances in every case.
7.3 The Committee must evaluate whether there are substantial grounds for believing that the complainant would be personally in danger of being subjected to torture upon his return to the Islamic Republic of Iran.

The same experts also expressed their concern about reports of arrests and detention without charge and ill-treatment of detainees.
7.5 In addition, the Committee takes note of the concluding observations on the Islamic Republic of Iran adopted by the Human Rights Committee on 2 November 2011, in which the latter Committee stated that it "is deeply concerned about the frequent violations of fair trial guarantees provided for under the Covenant, especially in the Revolutionary Courts" (CCPR/C/IRN/CO/3, para. 21), and that it "is deeply concerned at reports of the widespread use of torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment in detention facilities, particularly of those accused of national security-related crimes or tried in Revolutionary Courts, which in some cases have resulted in the death of the detainee" (ibid., para. 14).
7.6 The Committee further notes that the Human Rights Committee expressed its concern that:
Many newspapers, magazines, as well as the Journalists Association, have been closed by the authorities since 2008, and that many journalists, newspaper editors, film-makers and media workers have been arrested and detained since the 2009 presidential elections.
The Committee is also concerned about the monitoring of Internet use and contents, blocking of websites that carry political news and analysis, slowing down of Internet speeds and jamming of foreign satellite broadcasts, in particular since the 2009 presidential elections (art.19) (ibid., para. 27).

7.8 In relation to the alleged sentence in absentia to five years' imprisonment, the Committee notes the State party's submission that the court documents presented in support of the asylum application, and in support of the complainant's claim that he would be at risk of imprisonment and torture if returned to the Islamic Republic of Iran, are not authentic, in accordance with a verification conducted by the Norwegian Embassy in Tehran.
7.7 The Committee takes note of the previous interest of the Iranian authorities in the complainant, as demonstrated by his arrest and interrogation, and the summons received by him in 2003 to appear before the Revolutionary Court in Tehran, due to his journalistic activities.
The Committee notes that the complainant does not submit that he was tortured at any time by the Iranian authorities during his arrest and interrogation in 2003.

Furthermore, the debates over the last 15 years on reform of the Security Council have produced no result, due to the serious conflicting views among Member States, including permanent Council members.
Consequently, Member States have increasingly less confidence in the Security Council.
The Security Council should remain the United Nations body responsible for global peace and security and never be used as a tool to legitimize the pursuance of strategic interests of certain countries.
For that reason, it is important, first and foremost, to ensure that the principle of impartiality is strictly observed in all activities of the Security Council.
Peaceful settlement of conflicts through dialogue and negotiations among the parties concerned should be the main remedy in every case.

That necessitates establishing a mechanism to make Security Council resolutions effective only after endorsement by the General Assembly.
The Security Council should not be a court that unjustifiably handles only developing countries.
That is also imperative for the democratization of the United Nations and the fair settlement of conflicts.
Secondly, the Security Council should be reformed as early as possible, given the current rapidly changing world situation.
In that regard, it is important to ensure that non-member States of the Council and other developing countries, which are the overwhelming majority of the United Nations membership, are fully represented.

Even today, Japan -- far from honestly reflecting on its past crimes against humanity and making sincere reparations -- resorts to despicable acts to seize Tok Islet, which is a sacred territory of Korea, and suppresses the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan, an organization of overseas Korean citizens of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
Worse still, Japan has also attempted to raise issues irrelevant to world peace and security in the Security Council, such as the so-called abduction issue, only evoking the alarm and denunciation of Member States, as revealed last June.
If a permanent seat were given to such an irresponsible and brazen-faced Japan, it would be the same as encouraging Japan's ambition for its old dream of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.
That would be extremely dangerous for the entire United Nations membership.
Last but not least, it is equally important that Security Council reform should encompass measures to ensure transparency in the activities of the Council by opening informal consultations to the public and allowing interested countries, including parties to conflicts, to attend informal meetings.

We believe that that subject should be considered one of the priorities of the sixty-third session of the General Assembly.
After many years of preparatory discussions, the time has come to move that agenda forward.
Let us therefore fully implement decision 62/557 that has finally opened the door for a meaningful intergovernmental process.
That unanimous decision is binding on all of us.
From that perspective, we have taken due note of the plans recently announced by the President of the General Assembly.

Subsequently, the basis of the negotiations consists of all proposals submitted so far by all Member States and groupings.
The Czech delegation is convinced that under the able leadership of Ambassador Tanin we will proceed quickly, while preserving the basic principles of transparency, openness and inclusiveness that are absolutely indispensable to maintain the confidence and active participation of each and every Member State of the United Nations interested in the reform process.
Our delegation is ready to participate in an open and cooperative spirit.
At this juncture, we do not want to pre-empt the outcome of the future negotiations.
At the same time, we believe that any reasonable reform of the Security Council should lead to an expansion of its membership in both the permanent and the non-permanent categories and make it more equitable.

Undoubtedly, the deliberations of the Open-ended Working Group on Security Council Reform have created a solid platform on which we can build.
Thus, it has fulfilled its mandate. However, none of its future activities should block or slow down the proceedings in the next phase, namely, the intergovernmental process.

That is a task given to us by our political leaders at the 2005 Summit.
The Czech Republic is ready to work hard towards that goal.
Let us start sooner rather than later.
Mr. Swe (Myanmar): At the outset, I would like to thank the Permanent Representative of Costa Rica for introducing the annual report of the Security Council (A/63/2).
Under Article 24, paragraph 1, of the Charter, States Members of the United Nations confer on the Security Council the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security and agree that, in carrying out its duties, the Council acts on their behalf.

The report indicates that the Council had yet another year of intensive work.
The principal approach of the report remains similar to that of last year.

That underscores the urgency of reforming the Council, so that it can meet the challenges of a new era.
The debate on the question of equitable representation on and increase in the membership of the Security Council and related matters is taking place with that sense of urgency.
However, our collective efforts in the Working Group established under General Assembly resolution 48/26 have not borne fruit.
We share the view that reform of the Council must be an integral part of the ongoing reform process of the United Nations and that the reform of the United Nations will remain incomplete without an actual reform of the Council.

Accordingly, the Working Group was mandated to continue its work.
Furthermore, the General Assembly also agreed to launch an intergovernmental negotiation process on Council reform (decision 61/561).
The momentum generated during the sixty-first session was maintained by the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session.
Regrettably, all subsequent attempts have not resulted in significant headway, due to entrenched positions.
We are discouraged by the conclusion of the task force that there is insufficient support for launching the intergovernmental negotiations.

The representation of African countries must also be adequately addressed.
At the same time, the Council's agenda, procedures and working methods are equally important in making the Council more transparent and democratic.
In connection with the Council's agenda, we are particularly concerned by the failure of the Council to strictly adhere to the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations.
The Non-Aligned Movement, which represents the overwhelming number of the membership of the United Nations, has stressed on many occasions that the Council's decision to initiate formal and informal debates on the situation in any Member State or any matter that does not constitute a threat to international peace and security is contrary to Article 24 of the Charter.
Reform of the Council's procedures and working methods must be aimed at promoting transparency and accountability in the Council's treatment of issues of interest to Member States.

The Council's lack of willingness to hold open debates on such issues and its restriction on participation in their consideration are at odds with Article 31 of the Charter, under which any United Nations member may participate in any Council debate on issues that it considers affect it.
To promote greater transparency and accountability, the rest of the Member States should be afforded more opportunities to engage in the substantive work of the Council.
My delegation considers that continued improvement in the working methods of the Security Council should not be held hostage to progress on the issues of membership expansion and representation.
In that regard, we should strive for more progress.
The continued impasse on the question of Security Council reform is highly lamentable.

The stakes have long been laid and we need to move with urgency, since the democratization of the Security Council has been very inconsequential.
It would be unbecoming of me, at the early stages of my address, if I did not reaffirm and recapture the principles and intents of the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration, which remain beacons of hope for Africa and, by extension, for my own country.
Nobody needs a reminder of what is contained in the Ezulwini Consensus, and we will not tire in our efforts to fight for justice characterized by equitable geographical representation in the Security Council.
The status quo does not inspire confidence in the United Nations as a credible body that shelters the weak and the unfortunate.
The principles of Ezulwini are very compelling to the African cause.

The Open-ended Working Group on Security Council Reform has been constituted since 1994.
My delegation reaffirms its unwavering support for the Working Group.
Its report makes it succinctly clear that the Security Council should be reformed to ensure that it better represents the world of today.
That premise is a good one for negotiations, as some of the Permanent Five can attest.
The intergovernmental process should be undertaken without delay.
The Open-ended Working Group on Security Council Reform has been constituted since 1994.
My delegation reaffirms its unwavering support for the Working Group.
Its report makes it succinctly clear that the Security Council should be reformed to ensure that it better represents the world of today.
That premise is a good one for negotiations, as some of the Permanent Five can attest.
The intergovernmental process should be undertaken without delay.
For this, we support the efforts of the President of the General Assembly to implement a strategy of aggregation to simplification in the areas of categories of membership, extent of expansion, regional representation and the right of veto.
We seek not only structural reform of the Security Council, but also reform of the Council's working methods, which should demonstrate the virtues of transparency, fairness and participation by the membership.
This reform should be undertaken in partnership with the Security Council body set up for that purpose.
The "no reform" option is actually not an option at all.
Member States should carry this agenda forward as a way to vindicate the United Nations as a just and altruistic body.

We welcome the increase in public meetings and improved access over the past year.
But much more needs to be done to enhance the Council's transparency and accountability.
At present, States that are directly involved in the various issues addressed by the Council do not always have the opportunity to express their views in Council meetings.
And even when it is decided that meetings will be open to the wider membership, those decisions often come so late that many States are unable to prepare and make substantive contributions.
Last Tuesday, during the meeting of the Open-ended Working Group on Security Council Reform, the President of the General Assembly spoke about the very first meeting of the Security Council, on 17 January 1946, which was held at Church House, London.

What the President did not say, and which might come as a surprise to many of us in this Assembly, is that the first meetings of the Council were in fact held in the open and on record, with reports of the frank exchanges available for all to read.
It is said that there was so much transparency at that first meeting that the representative of the United Kingdom, without realizing that his microphone was switched on, was heard to complain, "That bloody Chairman has double-crossed me again!"

I am sure that everyone here has seen his banner, which reads "Towards the Democratization of the United Nations -- Every Country Counts".
If we are serious about turning this rhetoric into reality, we have to ensure that the views and interests of all of us, in particular the small States, are taken into account in the reform of the Security Council.
I heard some parties argue -- I must say rather disingenuously -- during the meeting of the Open-ended Working Group last Tuesday that a majority is defined by total population.
But I would remind this body that we are all Member States of this Organization.
It is the small States, while modest in the size of their populations, that make up the majority of States Members of the United Nations.

Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that small States are not disadvantaged in any reform arrangement.
With this in mind, I would like to make the following four points.
First, in any expansion of the Security Council, there should be more non-permanent seats, to provide more opportunities for small States to serve on the Council.
That is an important aspect of making the Council more reflective of the views of the membership.
Small States have few opportunities to serve regularly on the Council.

Small States have few opportunities to serve regularly on the Council.
Indeed, many have never served even a single term since becoming United Nations members.
I stress this point because all too often the discussions on reform revolve around the interests of the larger and medium-sized Powers.

We should not forget that small States have made valuable and constructive contributions during their stints as non-permanent members.
Likewise, any increase should accurately reflect geographic distribution.

We cannot have any one region dominating the nonpermanent seats.
Secondly, there have recently been proposals to create a new, intermediate category of long-term renewable or re-electable seats.
Again, this idea sounds like one that caters more to the larger and medium-sized countries.
As I stated previously, Singapore's preferred option is to expand both the permanent and non-permanent categories.

But if there ever is widespread support for going down the path of creating renewable or re-electable seats, that approach would have to be accompanied by measures like a "time-bar" to prevent larger and medium-sized countries from flip-flopping easily between the traditional nonpermanent category and any new, intermediate category, to the detriment of small States.
Singapore sees no reason why any country should have two bites of the cherry.

Thirdly, any reform arrangement should strike a good balance between the size and effectiveness of the Security Council.
Members often ask whether we can enlarge the Council without making it more unwieldy.
For balance and thoroughness, why not consider the flip side?
Can we improve the existing Council structure by reforming both categories of its current composition?
As the Ambassador of Costa Rica said in his statement at the Open-ended Working Group meeting last Tuesday, we might want to ask ourselves whether the current composition of the Security Council, especially in the permanent category, reflects today's geopolitical realities.

Fourthly, there is the question of the veto.
We remain opposed to granting the veto to any additional members.
It will only complicate decision-making and increase the chances of gridlock in the Security Council.
That said, we also recognize that the permanent five will not readily give up their right to veto.
But one cannot be overly pragmatic; we simply cannot avoid addressing the issue of the veto in any reform arrangement.

If the Council's permanent members will not give up their veto then, as a start, they should exercise leadership by agreeing to withhold the veto when considering compelling cases, such as instances of genocide or ethnic cleansing.

The views and interests of small States, which make up the majority of the United Nations, must also be taken into account.
Otherwise, there will be little progress on this issue.
Mr. Beck (Solomon Islands): I thank the President of the General Assembly for convening this plenary meeting.
I would like to join others in thanking Ambassador Jorge Urbina of Costa Rica, current President of the Security Council, for presenting the Council's informative report (A/63/2).
My delegation welcomes the discussion on this document.

Mr. Ettalhi (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke in Arabic): At the outset, I would like, on behalf of the members of the League of Arab States, to congratulate the President of the General Assembly on this successful debate on two important items we have been studying for several years.
Our consideration of these items stems from our interest in finding an outlet that would lead to Security Council reform which is a sine qua non for overall United Nations reform.
The League of Arab States welcomes the recommendations contained in the report of the Open-ended Working Group on the Question of Equitable Representation on and Increase in the Membership of the Security Council and Other Matters related to the Security Council (A/62/47) especially as concerns the initiation of intergovernmental negotiations.
In this connection, the Arab League emphasizes the need to render these negotiations open, inclusive and transparent.

The reform process should bring about the participation of non-Council members, particularly those countries that are directly concerned with issues under discussion, as set out in Article 31 of the Charter.
Informal, closed consultations should be limited, and more open discussions should be available to increase transparency rather than restrict participation by Member States.
More inclusive briefings for nonCouncil members should also take place.
With regard to the item entitled "Report of the Security Council", the Arab Group expresses its appreciation for the initiative of the delegation of Viet Nam to hold an inclusive briefing for Member States on the report before its submission.
At the same time, it believes that the report before us today (A/63/2) does not give a clear picture of what is transpiring in the Council.

Nor does it reflect the Council's commitment to the content of General Assembly resolutions, in particular as regards avoiding the narrative aspect and including in the report an analysis of the reasons that prompted the Council to adopt such resolutions as well as the various positions of States, especially the permanent members, and the reasons standing between the Council and its taking decisive positions related to important issues, such as the maintenance of international peace and security.

By the same token, we hope that the General Assembly will take timely action to make up for the Council's occasional impotence, given the occasional use or threat of use of the veto.

We are confident that he will make our debates as fruitful and dynamic as possible and will guide our efforts to undertake intergovernmental negotiations in plenary consultations of the Assembly with the achievable goal of building a more representative and effective Council.
We assure the President that he can count on my delegation's full support and cooperation.
Mr. Badji (Senegal) (spoke in French): My delegation is pleased to participate again this year, in the consideration of the agenda item on the report of the Security Council. We thank Ambassador Jorge Urbina, Permanent Representative of Costa Rica and President of the Security Council for the month of November, for having introduced the Council's report for this year (A/63/2), which is before is for our consideration today.

Indeed, it should provide an opportunity for the plenary, deliberative body of our universal Organization to be informed in detail about how the Security Council has discharged its responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security as well as about the reasons underpinning the action or inaction of the Security Council.
However, as several delegations have stressed, the current format of the Security Council report does not always provide the necessary elements for assessment and to spark and sustain a fruitful discussion.

The reason is that Security Council reform has become necessary due to the three-fold requirement of modernity, justice and legitimacy of the Council.
The position of Africa is known.
The Permanent Representative of Mauritius described it well in his statement at the beginning of the debate.
Senegal defends that position, recalling that we cannot talk of equitable representation on the Council without remedying the injustice of Africa being the only continent that does not have a permanent seat on it.
Decision 62/557, adopted on 15 September 2008, offers new prospects that could finally make it possible for us to embark on genuine intergovernmental negotiations.

However, we need to remember that, in addition to gaining a more modern Council, one adapted to the realities of the twenty-first century, we need above all a more legitimate Council, one that is in a position, thanks to enhanced credibility and authority, to deal with the enormous challenges we face in maintaining international peace and security.

Senegal defends that position, recalling that we cannot talk of equitable representation on the Council without remedying the injustice of Africa being the only continent that does not have a permanent seat on it.
Decision 62/557, adopted on 15 September 2008, offers new prospects that could finally make it possible for us to embark on genuine intergovernmental negotiations.
However, we need to remember that, in addition to gaining a more modern Council, one adapted to the realities of the twenty-first century, we need above all a more legitimate Council, one that is in a position, thanks to enhanced credibility and authority, to deal with the enormous challenges we face in maintaining international peace and security.
The President's diligence and patience will be, when we meet again, the instruments for finalizing this reform that we sincerely want and that will give the United Nations the means to better respond to the aspirations of the peoples of the world.
Mr. Borg (Malta): This year's report of the Security Council (A/63/2) once again demonstrates the array of challenges which the members of the Council were confronted with during the 12 months of the reporting period.
The 58 resolutions adopted by the Council as well as the 50 presidential statements clearly indicate the intensive work carried out by the Council, acting on behalf of the United Nations Member States and the international community at large, in the collective maintenance of peace and security.
As stated in the introduction to the report, "Africa again featured prominently on the Council's agenda" during the 12 months.
Indeed, 16 African countries were the subject of careful examination by the Council.

This situation continues to highlight the critical importance of the Council, working closely with the General Assembly, in timely and appropriate action to prevent, under the relevant provision of the Charter, aggravation of particular situations or disputes.
In that regard, we welcome the mission to five African countries organized last June by the Security Council, which brought the work of the Council closer to the Governments and peoples of conflict areas.

While we do not underestimate the complex nature of this question, we regret that the Council has not been able to agree on timely and urgent measures to address the situations that continue to block progress towards a comprehensive and durable solution to this issue.
The international community welcomed the Annapolis conference.
The Security Council has a fundamental role to play in solidly backing the outcome of that conference in order to advance the Middle East peace process.
It is our hope that in the coming months the Council will review its efforts in support of the current positive engagement between Israelis and Palestinians.
The role of United Nations peacekeepers in the numerous ongoing operations should not be underestimated and therefore needs the full support and encouragement of all Member States.

Post-conflict peacebuilding is an important element linking the work of the Security Council and of the Peacebuilding Commission.

In all these areas, the role of regional and subregional organizations in the maintenance of international peace and security must continue to be strengthened.
Chapter VIII of the Charter of the United Nations sets out the purpose and objectives for the Security Council in "the development of pacific settlement of local disputes through such regional arrangements or by such regional agencies either on the initiative of the states concerned or by reference from the Security Council" (Article 52, para. 3).

Mr. Beck (Solomon Islands), Vice-President, took the Chair.
My delegation welcomes the initiative of holding thematic debates, which have taken place in the Security Council with the participation of a considerable number of Member States.

The central element guiding the reform of the Security Council should be the strengthening of its authority through its nature and legitimacy, whereby all Member States have the equal opportunity to represent their country on the Security Council.
Mr. Gonsalves (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines): Saint Vincent and the Grenadines aligns itself with the statements made at the 53rd meeting by Barbados on behalf of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and by Cuba on behalf of the NonAligned Movement.
According to our Charter, the Security Council has the "primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security".
It is through the prism of that formidable responsibility that Saint Vincent and the Grenadines views this report and the question of Security Council reform.
In our own region, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines would like to thank the Council for continuing to focus its attention on the threats to peace and security that confront our brothers and sisters in Haiti.

There are also many hotspots and flashpoints for conflict across our troubled planet, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines thanks the Council for the work that it has done, and continues to do, in pursuing its functions and responsibilities.
We are grateful for every conflict contained, resolved or avoided through the work of the Council.
We also acknowledge the magnificent bravery and sacrifice of troops, police and other personnel, and we thank those States who have volunteered their sons and daughters to the noble cause of world peace.

However, it is the nature of the Council's work and mandate that its shortcomings and failures will attract more attention than its successes.
That is as it should be, because every failure of the Council represents lives lost, peoples uprooted and development being reversed.
In that regard, my delegation confesses some disappointment with the content of the report (A/63/2) before us.

As the world has moved from great-Power unilateralism to multipolar, multilateral interconnectedness, and as new Powers and threats have emerged and old ones have faded, the Council remains stubbornly resistant to change and impervious to the logic of an evolving world.
As the United Nations trumpets equality, the Council remains fundamentally unequal.
As we cheer emerging democracies, the Council is firmly undemocratic and unrepresentative.
As we demand transparency, the Council's functions remain shrouded and opaque.
And as we decolonize the world, our most cherished international function remains the sole province of a virtual five-headed monarchy, largely unchanged in 60 years of global metamorphosis.

There will undoubtedly be hiccups on the road to substantive Security Council reform.
However, we urge all Member States to approach the process in good faith and with flexibility.
Yesterday, the President again reminded us of the noble imperative of: "a more democratic United Nations, where every country counts" (A/63/PV.53).
That imperative is rooted in the principle of the sovereign equality of States, which underpins the operation of this body.
That equality might be a legal fiction, but the legality of that fiction is enshrined in our Charter and there is no place for Orwellian notions that some States are more equal than others.

In response we ask: What of the 134 Members who have never had the opportunity to voice an opinion on the current Council?
Are we not collectively and individually influential?
And why should we accept the credibility of a process that denies us our right to stand up and be counted?
To fear the transformative democratic power of the vote or to weigh and rank States' positions by their military and financial might is to debase the foundations upon which this institution stands.
We have as our road map a decision that explicitly divorces the consultative role of the Open-ended Working Group on Security Council Reform from the substantive negotiations to come in the General Assembly plenary.

The clarity of decision 62/557 leaves no doubt as to the urgency of our task.
Saint Vincent and the Grenadines has no aspirations to join the permanent membership of a reformed Council and is under no illusions as to the difficulties inherent in the reform process or the myriad modern challenges facing a reformed Council.
Instead, we approach this issue from a position of principle and pragmatism, and we see the efficacious functioning of a democratic, representative, nimble, responsive and transparent Council as absolutely essential to the core values of the United Nations.
Let us rise above pettiness and dilatory tactics and get on with the serious work of reform.
Ms. Štiglic (Slovenia): At the outset, let me thank the President of the Assembly for convening this meeting.

First, there should be six additional permanent members from all the regions of the world.
Secondly, there should be an additional category of non-permanent members with a more frequent rotation, six in any particular composition of the Security Council, elected in accordance with a formula to be determined by the General Assembly and alternating every second two-year term.
Thirdly, the remaining eight non-permanent members would be elected in accordance with the principle of equitable geographical distribution.
Thus, the total size of the reformed Security Council would not exceed 25 members.
The amendment to the Charter authorizing the enlargement of the Security Council would also need to include a review clause allowing for a comprehensive review of the new system.

Malaysia reiterates its call for there to be more regular, open briefings on the work of the Security Council, so that non-members of the Council can be kept abreast of its work.
We note that the overall international peace and security situation remains very challenging, including during the period covered by the report.
The Security Council has maintained the same rigorous pace as last year in holding 219 formal meetings, as compared to 224 meetings in 2007, including 191 public meetings.
The Council also adopted 58 resolutions and 50 presidential statements.
We note, too, that the Council held 177 closed consultations of the whole and an undisclosed number of informal consultations.

We note the continued focus by the Security Council on the challenging situations besetting several regions in Africa, which also reflect the complex socio-economic and political developments of the continent as a whole.
One third of the 42 main items relating to the maintenance of peace and security deal with conflicts in Africa.
Several debates relating directly to Africa were held, including those on peace and security in Africa and the role of the Security Council in conflict prevention and resolution, particularly in Africa.
In addition, several thematic issues also have reference to Africa, including the issues of the role of regional and subregional organizations in the maintenance of peace and security, post-conflict peacebuilding, children and armed conflict, small arms, and women and peace and security.
We note also that a Security Council mission was organized to visit five African countries.
We note the continued focus by the Security Council on the challenging situations besetting several regions in Africa, which also reflect the complex socio-economic and political developments of the continent as a whole.

We also regret that the Security Council has failed to implement its own resolutions on this subject including its resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).
The continued failure of the Security Council to solve the Palestinian question has undermined its credibility in the maintenance of the international peace and security, which I should recall, is a responsibility conferred on it by Article 24 of the Charter.
Malaysia takes note of the Security Council's own effort to improve its working methods.
During the period covered in the report, the Council adopted presidential note S/2007/749, which outlined new measures regarding participation in informal consultations of the general membership of the United Nations and of experts, the issuance of the summary statement of issues of which the Council is seized and the preparation of the annual report to the General Assembly.
We applaud the thickness of this year's Security Council report in terms of volume but note that, even with the extra detail, the report is limited to the mere factual presentation of the activities of the Council and its subsidiary bodies.

Likewise, the report should also be transparent concerning the failure of the Council to adopt a particular draft resolution or action.
In August 2008 the Security Council held an open debate on the subject of improving its own working methods (see S/PV.5968).
Malaysia believes that a number of useful proposals were made during the open debate which are worth revisiting.
We hope that those proposals will not merely be relegated to the annals of history.
It seems to my delegation that the workload of the Council has increased in recent years.

It seems to my delegation that the workload of the Council has increased in recent years.
This seems to be a ongoing trend and is likely to continue in view of the outstanding issues and breaking conflicts that necessitate the Council's attention.
The Council is thus fast reaching its capacity.
In order to avoid the Council becoming overstretched in areas which are not within its specific mandate to oversee, the Council should refocus on its core business: the maintenance of international peace and security under Chapters VI and VII of the Charter of the United Nations.
The item on the "Question of equitable representation on and increase in the membership of the Security Council and other matters related to the Security Council" has been on the agenda of the General Assembly since September 1992, though attempts were made as early as 1979 to include it in the agenda.

While we believed that there was much value in taking carefully considered steps rather than a giant leap into the unknown, the movement was too snail-paced for the comfort of all.
However, the adoption of decision 62/557 on 15 September 2008 gives us cause to be optimistic that the day has finally arrived when we can all begin to engage in intergovernmental negotiations.
We believe that we actually have a chance to make concrete progress.
Decision 62/557 provides a definitive timeline, by which we should begin intergovernmental negotiations no later than 28 February 2009.
We saw the divisiveness that was apparent in the first meeting of the Open-ended Working Group, which concluded last Monday.

We saw the divisiveness that was apparent in the first meeting of the Open-ended Working Group, which concluded last Monday.
There seemed to be a reinterpretation of decision 62/557, which we had adopted by consensus.
We are quite concerned at this development and hope that it is not a reflection of what we should expect to encounter when we begin intergovernmental negotiations.
We reiterate that, amid the interpretation of 62/557, including on whether the commencement of intergovernmental negotiations would be determined by the outcome of the Open-ended Working Group's addressing of framework and modalities, the intergovernmental negotiations will proceed as agreed by 28 February 2009.
We trust in the leadership and wisdom of the President of the General Assembly to ensure that the process leading towards reform of the Security Council will yield concrete results in negotiations that are open, transparent and inclusive.

That will make it possible for such reform to be truly owned and accepted by the entire membership, to enter into force as soon as possible and to be implemented and effective.
As for the various issues that will arise in the forthcoming negotiations, our position is well known concerning the size and composition of the Security Council.
We are convinced that a more democratic, representative, responsible and thus more legitimate Council can result from an expansion of the category of non-permanent members, which are the only members elected periodically by the Assembly and thus accountable to it.
Our position, which does not favour an expansion of the permanent-member category, should be interpreted not as a rejection of a particular country or group of countries, but rather as a matter of principle based on the general interest of the Organization, which is far greater than the individual interest of any Member State.
With regard to the Council's decision-making mechanisms, it should be recalled that any expansion of the Council's composition will necessarily require that the majority needed to take decisions be adjusted.

With regard to the Council's decision-making mechanisms, it should be recalled that any expansion of the Council's composition will necessarily require that the majority needed to take decisions be adjusted.
From that perspective, our position is that a distinction should be made between the various types of Council decisions -- just as the Charter distinguishes between procedural and substantive issues -- and that we should also take into account the diverse scope of substantive Council decisions affecting Chapter VII or other types of issues under the Charter.
We believe that the use of the veto should be reserved exclusively for decisions that the Council adopts to implement Chapter VII of the Charter, because such issues require agreement among the permanent members.
We are in favour of the various proposals aimed at limiting the use of the veto in cases in which it is not really necessary or required under the Charter.
Concerning the issue of regional representation, we are convinced of the need to give regional groups a greater role in designating and endorsing their Council candidatures, ensuring appropriate subregional representation in each of them.
We also favour the establishment of mechanisms that would guarantee the representation of transregional groups, such as the League of Arab States and the Organization of the Islamic Conference, including through arrangements among the regional organizations concerned.

Mongolia has consistently stood for a just and equitable enlargement of the Security Council by increasing the number of both permanent and nonpermanent members, while ensuring due representation of developing and developed countries alike.
We also believe that the Security Council needs to further improve its working methods.
This is part and parcel of a comprehensive reform package.
Taking note of last August's open debate of the Security Council on its working methods (see S/PV.5968), we support the proposal of Costa Rica, Jordan, Liechtenstein, Singapore and Switzerland -- Small Five States -- aimed at enhancing the accountability, transparency and inclusiveness of the Council's work with a view to strengthening its legitimacy and effectiveness.
We also believe that open debates and interactive briefings by the Security Council are a commendable practice to be further enhanced to the benefit of non-members.

As to the report of the Security Council, we support the view that its content needs more in-depth analysis and that relevant amendments to that effect could be introduced into the provisional rules of procedure of the Security Council.
We would also like to commend the innovative efforts of the Permanent Mission of Viet Nam, which sought to interact with nonmembers before the finalization of the Security Council report.
We believe that that initiative could also be followed by future Presidents of the Security Council.

That position is already well known and has remained unchanged throughout all the sessions of the Open-ended Working Group.
We would, however, like to reiterate one point that has been central to all the statements by the delegation of Uruguay, namely, our firm opposition to all solutions that grants the right to veto to new members of the Security Council, either directly or indirectly, through moratoriums or any other mechanism aimed at prolonging the extension of that right over time.
Uruguay's principled position can be traced back to the very establishment of the Organization.
In the San Francisco Conference, the delegation of Uruguay stated that members of the Security Council should enter that body without distinction as to prerogative or rights, while accepting that those countries that had carried the greatest burden in the war be assured seats on the Council but not indefinitely and only for a period that might be judged advisable, say eight or ten years, for example.

At this stage, it is reasonable to consider the best possible solution.
We believe that the facilitators' report could be a point of convergence that might serve as a basis for inclusive negotiations.
Lastly, my delegation reiterates the following objectives and guiding principles of Security Council reform.
First, the sovereign equality of Member States must be respected.
Secondly, equitable geographic distribution must be ensured.

We are willing to participate in consultations and negotiations in a flexible way, based on our principled positions.
It is our hope that Member States and groups will also show greater flexibility, political will and commitment, in order to advance Security Council reform.
Mr. Çorman (Turkey): I would like to begin by thanking the President for convening this joint meeting which provides a very timely opportunity to reflect on the activities of the Security Council as well as on the Council's ongoing process of reform.
I would also like to express our appreciation to Ambassador Jorge Urbina of Costa Rica, President of the Security Council, for presenting the annual report of the Council to the General Assembly (A/63/2).
The report provides an accurate account of the work of the Security Council and demonstrates the multiplicity of issues considered by the Council under its responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security.

Finally, the report points to many of the important challenges which lie ahead for the Council, albeit indirectly, as well as the challenges that await our Organization as a whole.
While the report could have been more analytical and less descriptive, we are also well aware of the complexity of many of the issues that are featured on the Council's agenda -- a complexity that would have rendered such an analytical approach extremely difficult to implement.
That said, there is still much room for further improvement of the working methods of the Council to enhance its transparency, accountability and inclusiveness.
We therefore encourage the Council to continue its efforts to that end.

We attach importance to the Working Group, which, as the main forum for this discussion, should set the stage for the intergovernmental negotiations that will soon start informally at the General Assembly.
In our opinion, setting the stage means completing the consultations and discussions in the Working Group on the main parameters of the intergovernmental negotiations.
With these considerations in mind, we have lent our support to the proposal by Mexico and the Republic of Korea on scheduling several more meetings of the Working Group prior to the start of the intergovernmental negotiations by February 2009.
We believe that, with sufficient preparation prior to these negotiations and mutual flexibility to be demonstrated by all parties, we will be able to bring the process of Security Council reform to a successful conclusion.
The General Assembly may count on our delegation's full cooperation, support and flexibility in this process.

Mr. Valero Briceño (Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela) (spoke in Spanish): The delegation of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela would like to welcome the convening of this meeting because of its importance to the consideration of the reform of the Security Council and of the United Nations system in general.
Likewise, we would like to acknowledge the report of the Security Council presented to us by Ambassador Jorge Urbina, Permanent Representative of Costa Rica, in his capacity as President of the Security Council for November 2008.
We would also like to highlight the work carried out by Ambassador Le Luong Minh, Permanent Representative of Viet Nam, in the preparation of the report in question.
The changes to the international scene following the end of the cold war reaffirmed the need to encourage discussions on adapting the United Nations and its bodies, especially the Security Council, to current realities in order to allow them to effectively respond to the challenges of peace, security and development.
As members are aware, the General Assembly adopted decision 62/557 by consensus, renewing the mandate of the Open-ended Working Group on the Question of Equitable Representation on and Increase in the Membership of the Security Council and Other Matters Related to the Security Council.

That type of meeting should be an exemption.
The predominant rule should be public meetings, as established in rule 48 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.
That type of proceeding prevents greater participation by the majority of Member States in the daily life of the United Nations.
We cannot advocate the democratization of international relations or the promotion of democracy in countries while defending the status quo, which excludes and marginalizes the majority of Member States when it comes to taking major decisions.
In a spirit of greater transparency, openness and participation, the Security Council should hold consultations with the countries affected by its decisions.

Non-member countries should be invited to participate in informal consultations using a procedure similar to that established in Articles 31 and 32 of the United Nations Charter.
The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela believes that efforts to reform the United Nations should necessarily strengthen the General Assembly, the Organization's main body for deliberation and policymaking and the most representative body of the Organization.
In this context, in order to ensure the necessary level of Council accountability to the Member States, the Council should submit periodic, substantive and analytical reports to the Assembly.
The current method applied by the Council of presenting annual reports that are only factual in nature has not produced the desired results.

Mr. Sangqu (South Africa): We thank the President of the General Assembly for convening this meeting.
We would like to align ourselves with the statement delivered by the Permanent Representative of Mauritius in his capacity as Chairman of the African Group.
We would also like to commend the President of the Security Council for the month of November, the Permanent Representative of Costa Rica, for presenting the annual report of the Council (A/63/2), and the delegation of Viet Nam for preparing the report.
The annual report of the Security Council before us indicates the many areas all over the world, particularly in Africa, where the Council remains engaged in helping to resolve conflicts.
The Council also stimulated constructive debate on important global issues such as security sector reform, the role of women in peacekeeping operations and the relationship between the Council and regional organizations in terms of Chapter VIII of the Charter.

The annual report of the Security Council before us indicates the many areas all over the world, particularly in Africa, where the Council remains engaged in helping to resolve conflicts.
The Council also stimulated constructive debate on important global issues such as security sector reform, the role of women in peacekeeping operations and the relationship between the Council and regional organizations in terms of Chapter VIII of the Charter.
Mr. Sangqu (South Africa): We thank the President of the General Assembly for convening this meeting.

Through that watershed decision, the general membership of the United Nations decided to move away from a process of endless consultations on the issue of the reform of the Council and to commence meaningful, direct intergovernmental negotiations in informal plenary of the General Assembly during its sixty-third session, but not later than 28 February 2009.
As you indicated, Sir, in your statement of 11 November, there is a need to implement that decision in letter and spirit.
Decision 62/557 indicates that positions and proposals of Member States, regional groups and other Member State groupings shall form the basis for the intergovernmental negotiations.
We believe that the positions of Member States, regional groupings and other Member State groupings are quite clear and have been presented over and over again.
The basis, therefore, for starting intergovernmental negotiations does exist.

As for my delegation, we are on record as supporting the African position as espoused in the Ezulwini consensus.
We also have a clear African Union Summit mandate to participate in the forthcoming intergovernmental negotiations on the basis of the Ezulwini Consensus and Sirte Declaration.
We should also proceed with the negotiations by clustering issues, as indicated in paragraph (e) (ii) of decision 62/557, and focus on the following five key issues: categories of membership; the question of the veto; regional representation; size of an enlarged Council, and working methods of the Council, as well as the relationship between the Council and the General Assembly.

South Africa would have no problem with the Open-ended Working Group on the Question of Equitable Representation on and Increase in the Membership of the Security Council and Other Matters Related to the Security Council meeting as many times as it wishes to consult on all matters related to the reform of the Security Council.
In fact, paragraph (f) of the decision decides that the Open-ended Working Group should continue to exert efforts during the present session of the General Assembly aimed at achieving general agreement among Member States.
However, looking at the substance of the issues proposed for discussion, my delegation is concerned that it seems that we again want to rehash and repeat the same consultative discussions the Open-ended Working Group has had over the past 15 years, which unfortunately have not been very helpful in moving the process of the reform forward.
We cannot reopen, renegotiate or amend that decision in any way.

Standing about 15 metres apart, the two suicide bombers detonated their charges almost simultaneously, sending pedestrians in the area scrambling for cover.
Two of those killed in the attack were foreign nationals, one from Romania and the other from China.
The attack occurred on the evening of Tish'a B'av, when Jews around the world gather to commemorate and mourn the destruction of the two ancient Jewish temples in Jerusalem.
Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for the attack.
Israel holds the Palestinian Authority and its Chairman, Yasser Arafat, responsible for the ongoing campaign of terrorism directed against the citizens of Israel.

Although it is impossible to thwart every attempted action, countless terror attacks have been prevented in recent weeks by the ongoing efforts of Israeli forces.

The Transitional Government of Ethiopia stated that, as far as Sub-Commission resolution 1993/5, paragraphs 3 and 25, is concerned, there are different national legislations that deal with the conditions for the protection of actions against slavery.
In practice, on the basis of the different legislations, almost all the provisions of the Slavery Conventions are being put into effect.
Ethiopia has already adopted provisions similar to those contained in conventions concerning individual human rights (Transition Period Charter of Ethiopia No. 1, 1991).
As regards paragraph 26 of the above resolution, the Transitional Government of Ethiopia reported that the national legislation prohibits forced labour practices.

The Government of Finland considers it important that the dangerously increasing problems of contemporary forms of slavery referred to in the inquiry of the Secretary-General are given the urgent attention they merit both at national and international, as well regional and global levels.
The basic concept of human dignity, present in all human rights treaties, cannot be allowed to be threatened by powerful economic interests involved in different forms of trafficking with sexuality.
Traffic in persons, prostitution and pornography are closely linked to economic questions.

In the autumn of 1993, a seminar on child prostitution was arranged jointly by organizations and authorities.
During the past few years, various forms of "commercial sex" have increased in Finland.
The rapid deterioration of the economic situation has caused mass unemployment.
The economic independence of women, which has been an important preventive factor against prostitution and other forms of exploitation of their sexuality, is threatened.
Job seekers no longer have the same possibilities as before to choose their employment.

The Ministry for Social Affairs and Health has stated that social welfare and health care services and social and economic support should be available both before the above-mentioned problems occur and in connection with help and rehabilitation for persons in the above-mentioned situations.
However, much remains to be done in the field of practical work to develop both prevention and rehabilitation services.
A seminar organized in February 1994 by the Council for Equality focused on these questions with the help of international experts.
Information is needed both in order to offer help and support and also for prevention of the problems.
In the administrative sector of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health, health and temperance education are used in order to support positive sexual behaviour and to prevent abuse of drugs.

I. Situation analysis
1. Cambodia is at a crossroads, poised between post-conflict rehabilitation and long-term economic and social development.
However, additional challenges must be addressed if Cambodia is to achieve the goals and objectives of the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) and the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
2. Poverty rates are high, with 35 per cent of the population living below the poverty line.
Poverty is predominantly rural and associated with landlessness, limited economic diversification, limited access to social services and large household size.
3. As of 2004, the population was estimated at 13.1 million, with 85 per cent living in rural areas.
The population is growing at an annual rate of 1.8 per cent, and the total fertility rate is 3.3 children per woman.

Approximately 85 per cent of deliveries take place at home.
Skilled personnel attend less than one third of all births, although the number of deliveries by skilled personnel is increasing.
The public health system is characterized by poorly motivated health providers, unpredictable costs and low-quality services.
7. Although the unmet need for family planning services is high at 32.6 per cent, the contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) is increasing, rising from 7 per cent in 1995 to 18.5 per cent in 2000, due partly to social marketing efforts.
Donors currently provide support to procure all contraceptive commodities, except public-sector condoms, which are funded through the Ministry of Health.

Transmission patterns are shifting, however.
Most new infections occur among married women and their children.
Increasing high-risk behaviour among youth and illicit drug use could fuel HIV transmission.
II. Past cooperation and lessons learned
9. UNFPA has been active in Cambodia since 1994.

II. Past cooperation and lessons learned
9. UNFPA has been active in Cambodia since 1994.
13. A key lesson learned was the value of working with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) on sensitive and emerging issues.
A case in point was in the area of adolescent reproductive health. Adolescent reproductive health issues and lessons culled from UNFPA-funded NGO initiatives informed Government evidence-based policy and strategy dialogues.
14. During 2001-2004, Cambodia made gains in harmonizing and aligning donor support.
In 2003, the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the Department for International Development of the United Kingdom (DFID) and the United Nations worked together in developing a common country assessment, country programmes and in monitoring and evaluation.
15. UNFPA is a core partner in three government-donor technical working groups and is active in the partnership between the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, DFID and the United Nations country team.

16. The value of working through a SWAp was an important lesson of the second country programme.
Since 2004, UNFPA has provided support to the Ministry of Health through a SWAp.
Such an approach supports the institutional structures and planning processes of the Government, minimizes transaction costs, integrates reproductive health initiatives within overall planning and service delivery structures, and mainstreams the ICPD agenda into policy and strategy dialogues.
III. Proposed programme
17. The third country programme is based on (a) an analysis of the population, reproductive health, HIV and gender situation in Cambodia; (b) the participatory poverty assessment jointly undertaken by the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, DFID and the United Nations country team; (c) the United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) for 2006-2010; (d) the rectangular strategy of the Government and the national poverty-reduction strategy; and (e) lessons learned since 1994.

5. The estimated additional requirements of $140,731,900 take into account resources already provided by the General Assembly for the maintenance of MINURCAT, pursuant to its resolution 62/233 B, and provide, as detailed in paragraphs 8 to 10 below, for the initial deployment by 30 June 2009 of 4,250 military contingent personnel ($67,871,200), expansion of existing and construction of new facilities and infrastructure to accommodate military personnel, including acquisition of equipment necessary to equip military camps, rehabilitation and expansion of existing airfields ($60,002,100) and deployment of additional air assets ($12,858,600).
6. The staffing establishment of the MINURCAT Division of Mission Support approved for the 2008/09 period reflects its requirements for the support of the military liaison officers, United Nations police and substantive staff.
In view of Security Council resolution 1861 (2009), in which the Council authorized the deployment of a military component of MINURCAT to follow up EUFOR, with the transfer of authority from EUFOR to the United Nations on 15 March 2009, the immediate augmentation of the Mission's logistical planning, engineering and technical staffing capacity is required in order to prepare for the deployment of the United Nations military force and support the significant engineering projects to be implemented in a short span of time.
7. The additional immediate staffing requirements of MINURCAT involve the establishment of temporary positions for a Force Commander (D-2) and a Deputy Force Commander (D-1) as well as the establishment in the field and at United Nations Headquarters of 69 general temporary assistance positions, comprising 42 temporary positions at the Professional level and 27 at the General Service level.
The positions provide for the augmentation of the Mission's staffing capacity related to strategic transition planning, engineering, project management, contract management, hydrological assessments, aviation, movement control, procurement, finance and recruitment of civilian personnel.
5. The estimated additional requirements of $140,731,900 take into account resources already provided by the General Assembly for the maintenance of MINURCAT, pursuant to its resolution 62/233 B, and provide, as detailed in paragraphs 8 to 10 below, for the initial deployment by 30 June 2009 of 4,250 military contingent personnel ($67,871,200), expansion of existing and construction of new facilities and infrastructure to accommodate military personnel, including acquisition of equipment necessary to equip military camps, rehabilitation and expansion of existing airfields ($60,002,100) and deployment of additional air assets ($12,858,600).
6. The staffing establishment of the MINURCAT Division of Mission Support approved for the 2008/09 period reflects its requirements for the support of the military liaison officers, United Nations police and substantive staff.
In view of Security Council resolution 1861 (2009), in which the Council authorized the deployment of a military component of MINURCAT to follow up EUFOR, with the transfer of authority from EUFOR to the United Nations on 15 March 2009, the immediate augmentation of the Mission's logistical planning, engineering and technical staffing capacity is required in order to prepare for the deployment of the United Nations military force and support the significant engineering projects to be implemented in a short span of time.

In this context, we would like to highlight progress made and actions needed to implement the Platform recommendations concerning unwanted pregnancies and access to abortion.
2. The Platform for Action calls attention to the health consequences of unwanted pregnancies and unsafe abortions and calls for action to address this critical public health issue. Specifically, paragraph 106 (k) states that:
(a) Prevention of unwanted pregnancies must always be given the highest priority;
(b) Women who have unwanted pregnancies should have ready access to reliable information and compassionate counselling;
(c) All women should have access to treatment for complications arising from abortion;

The International Confederation of Midwives has stated that the education of midwives should include training to prepare them for their role in providing abortion-related services that ensure women's safety and well-being.
The Asia and Oceania Federation of Obstetrics and Gynaecology has urged obstetricians, gynaecologists and their professional associations to play a leadership role in promoting governmental action to promote access to safe abortion services for all indications permitted by law.
The Committee for Women's Sexual and Reproductive Rights of the Latin American Federation of Obstetric and Gynecological Societies (FLASOG) urged Latin American and Caribbean Ministries of Health to formulate regulations that will facilitate women's access to legal abortion, to preserve their health and lives and reduce maternal mortality.
7. Such policy guidance has contributed to notable, though still insufficient, progress in training physicians, midwives and other health providers and in making technologies for safe abortion available and affordable, including vacuum aspiration instruments and pharmacological, agents as recommended by WHO.

Reviewing laws with punitive measures against women who terminate pregnancies
8. Research shows that women have abortions just as frequently where abortion is legally restricted as where it is broadly permitted by law, but deaths and injuries from unsafe abortion occur at much higher rates in restrictive settings.
Accordingly, one of the most important actions to reduce mortality and morbidity due to unsafe abortions is the liberalization of abortion laws, which was carried out in about two dozen countries between 1995 and 2008.
Nevertheless, 40 per cent of women live in countries with highly restrictive abortion laws; this is the case for 92 per cent of women of reproductive age in Africa and 97 per cent in Latin America.
9. A number of national, state and provincial governments are now considering amending their laws to increase women's access to legal termination of pregnancy.
Twenty-seven countries have ratified the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa, which states that State Parties should take all appropriate steps to "protect the reproductive rights of women by authorizing medical abortion in cases of sexual assault, rape, incest, and where the continued pregnancy endangers the mental and physical health of the mother or the life of the mother or the foetus".

Actions required 11. In June 2009, the Human Rights Council adopted resolution 11/8 recognizing that maternal mortality is a health, development and human rights challenge. The Council asked all States to "renew their political commitment to eliminating preventable maternal mortality and morbidity at the local, national, regional and international levels, and to redouble their efforts to ensure the full and effective implementation of their human rights obligations [and] the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action...".
12. Despite progress achieved to date, much remains to be done if we are to stop women and girls from having unwanted pregnancies and suffering from unsafe abortions.

(e) Dedicating specific attention to the needs of adolescents, women with disabilities, women living with HIV and displaced women (refugees, asylum-seekers, etc.) in relation to unwanted pregnancies, contraception and abortion care;
(f) Promoting constructive dialogues at the national and local levels about unwanted pregnancy and unsafe abortion;
(g) Reforming policies and laws to increase access to safe abortion, in accordance with human rights principles; and
(h) Ensuring that these efforts receive sufficient financial support.
13. Unwanted pregnancies continue and unsafe abortions account for approximately 13 per cent of global maternal deaths, with a much higher proportion in many developing countries.

The team also visited areas inside Iraqi territory that had previously been shelled by Turkish forces.
Having informed you of the foregoing, the Government of Iraq lodges a strong protest against it and publicly condemns the action taken by the team in unlawfully infiltrating Iraqi territory and engaging in an operation to collect security and intelligence information by illegal means and in a manner that is incompatible with the principles of good-neighbourliness, the Charter of the United Nations, the norms of international law and the 1926 Iraq-Turkey boundary agreement.
The Government of Iraq reserves its legitimate right under international law to seek compensation for the damage caused by these Turkish violations of its territory and its airspace. Through you, it renews its call to the Government of Turkey to reconsider its policy with respect to the situation in northern Iraq and to promote the collaboration of the two countries on the basis of those considerations of good-neighbourliness and mutual respect for sovereignty to which Iraq is committed.
It will thus be possible to eliminate the reasons for the persistence of a situation that jeopardizes the interests of both countries and their desire to promote security and stability in the region so as to fulfil their peoples' aspirations for prosperity and progress.
In conveying to you the details of these Turkish violations, the Government of Iraq calls for an immediate and thorough inquiry into the incidents in question.

It does so because the practices of the Turkish forces, as represented by their repeated shelling of towns and villages in Iraq and their unlawful incursions into Iraqi territory, are in flagrant violation of Iraq's sovereignty and the inviolability of its territory and airspace, just as they are incompatible with relations of good-neighbourliness, the Charter of the United Nations, the norms of international law and the 1926 Iraq-Turkey boundary agreement.
These practices may also undermine stability in the region as a whole, which is suffering primarily from the anomalous situation created by the Americans and their allies in northern Iraq. There is also, of course, the human suffering inflicted on Iraqi citizens by the unlawful activities of the Turkish armed forces and their military operations inside Iraqi territory.
Iraq has on many occasions in the past alerted its Turkish neighbours to the consequences of allowing the anomalous situation in northern Iraq to continue. The retention of the forces involved in the so-called "Operation Poised Hammer" in Turkish territory on various pretexts has been nothing more than a cover for the perpetration of acts of aggression against Iraq and for interference in its internal affairs.

Proposal: In the fight against fraud (the sale of IDPs by groups and/or individual "pirates"), it is proposed to draw up a list of associations authorized by their Governments to issue, in their respective countries, IDPs.
The list will give exact details as to the model of the IDP issued.
This would permit rapid verification by the authorities concerned (customs, police, etc.) of the sales offers appearing on the "market".
5.2. Issuing of IDPs - Standardization and Harmonization of Types
The conditions for the issuing and the models of IDPs laid down by the 1949 and 1968 Conventions are different for each of the two Conventions; this results in confusion being created between the two models and in difficulties in implementing the provisions of the Convention.

This stems from limited knowledge of the authorities responsible for the verification of the permits of temporary residents, as to which Convention their country is or is not a Contracting Party.
A certain number of countries have ratified both Conventions, but only issue one model, usually the one which corresponds to the 1949 Convention.
Recognition of their validity would be conditioned by the recognition of the IDP.

11. While welcoming the legal reforms mentioned by the delegation, she wondered whether the process could be accelerated.

If the Government was truly committed to building partnerships with civil society, it should seriously reconsider introducing such a law, which would significantly restrict the work of such organizations.

12. Ms. Neubauer said that the report reflected the important role of the Jordanian National Commission for Women and Government efforts to promote the advancement of women in all walks of life, including through the establishment of various national councils and the development of a number of strategies which, if properly implemented, would benefit Jordanian women.
Having said that, the issues raised in the Committee's previous concluding comments regarding the national machinery remained a concern.
13. While commending the State party for establishing the National Centre for Human Rights, she was concerned by the statement in the report (para. 43) that the data contained in the Centre's annual report did not indicate any complaints referring specifically to discrimination against women, that the originators of other complaints were not broken down by sex, and that consequently it was not possible to determine the exact nature of complaints lodged by women.

She would be interested to know what was being done to raise women's awareness of their rights and to ensure that they turned to the Centre whenever their human rights were violated.
14. In order to be fully effective, the National Commission for Women needed to have well-defined functions and responsibilities, adequate resources, and the capacity to coordinate and monitor gender mainstreaming.
In that connection, she would appreciate concrete information about the findings of the study recently conducted by the Jordanian National Commission for Women on its structure and the development of an alternative structure that would be better adapted to evolving national conditions, and the mandate, functions, role and powers that were envisaged for it.
Lastly, the status of the National Strategy for Women was unclear.

Lastly, the status of the National Strategy for Women was unclear.
Was it simply a guiding document or had it been adopted by the Government?
If the latter was the case, she would be interested to know more about its objectives, time frame and mechanisms for monitoring progress.
With regard to the latter, it was not enough for the Commission to work through its Supervisory Board, particularly at the local level.
The State party might also wish to explain how the Commission worked with the gender units that had been set up in various ministries.

17. The fact that a number of discriminatory laws were still in force in Jordan meant that honour crimes continued to be committed.
For example, under article 98 of the Penal Code, sentences were reduced in cases where the perpetrator had committed the crime in a state of great fury and, for crimes usually punishable by death such as premeditated murder, the minimum sentence was just one year in prison if there were extenuating circumstances.
She had learned that the Jordanian courts had recently sentenced a man to just six months in prison for murdering his pregnant, divorced sister.
Under article 99 of the Penal Code, meanwhile, the courts could halve the sentence if the victim's family dropped the charges.
Family members were complicit in most honour killings and therefore almost always waived the right to file a complaint.

Furthermore, paragraph 22 of the responses referred to the introduction of two projects with a component related to gender issues and the revision of school curricula to make them more gender-sensitive.
According to Jordanian NGOs, however, the Government was not doing anything to change the social values taught to children or the stereotypical roles of women and girls.

Noting that the perpetrators of violence against women often received light sentences, she wondered whether there were any female judges.
24. Mr. Touq (Jordan) reiterated that the legislative and executive branches were fully independent and that the Government could not instruct Parliament to accelerate the adoption of a particular law.
She noted that the Government appeared to rely mainly on civil society organizations to combat prejudices and wondered whether there were any plans to develop a consistent national policy against stereotyping.
She also requested further information on the Government's recommendations to the media.

24. Mr. Touq (Jordan) reiterated that the legislative and executive branches were fully independent and that the Government could not instruct Parliament to accelerate the adoption of a particular law.
He agreed that it would be beneficial to elaborate a specific law on women's rights and would discuss the idea with the Jordanian National Commission for Women and other concerned parties.

It was difficult to evaluate the draft law on NGOs, as it had not yet been finalized.
Certain NGOs that received funds from abroad had been accused of using those funds to further foreign agendas.
Many civil society organizations had therefore called for the establishment of a coordinating mechanism on financing.
He was confident that the Government and civil society would develop a successful partnership and that an agreement on the regulation of NGOs would eventually be reached.
25. Jordan did not plan to withdraw its reservations to the Convention, as Islamic jurisprudence prevented it from doing so.

Concerning the possible amendment of articles that discriminated against women, including articles 98 and 340 of the Penal Code, it was clear that civil society needed to become more involved in educating and pressuring not just the general public but also members of Parliament.
With respect to the growth of fundamentalism, he pointed out that the Amman Message, which emphasized the core values of moderation, tolerance, equality between men and women and freedom of religion, was currently being used to train imams in Jordan and various European countries.
26. Lastly, he emphasized that value systems were very difficult to change and that the forces of resistance in the region were becoming stronger.

NGOs were cooperating with the Government on another initiative to remove women from "protective detention" and place them in shelters.
She was pleased to report that the number of honour killings in Jordan had decreased significantly.
29. Women comprised 4 per cent of civil court judges, and the quota for women students at the Judicial Institute had been set at 15 per cent.
The Ministry of Justice had established a Department for Women, Family and Human Rights, which was responsible for training judges and law enforcement officers in the rights of women and children.
Lastly, NGOs and the Government were drafting a law on protection against domestic violence, based on the model law prepared by the Special Rapporteur on violence against women.

With that proviso removed, there was thus no need for the relevant reservation to continue, and it was to be hoped that it would be removed in the near future.
As for coordination with the media, the current year had seen a large portion of airtime devoted to women's rights and their participation in public life.
Public information advertisements had been shown, as had programmes that would reinforce the message of women's equal status with men and their shared responsibility for achieving development.
Such broadcasts had been particularly useful in the recent elections.
31. Trafficking in women was forbidden under the Jordanian Penal Code, which laid down appropriate penalties for the crime.

Jordan was in close touch with international mechanisms in that area, and was currently developing special efforts and programmes, especially in the light of recent increases in freedom of movement that might lead to increased cross-border crime.

Laws were continuously under review to ensure that they were free of any discriminatory clauses.
The National Commission for Women had a government communications network that encompassed all gender liaison officers in all ministries.
A gender unit had been established in the Ministry of Planning, as an experiment; its work would be reviewed in a year or two, to see if the better approach to gender mainstreaming was to have designated units in every ministry or to continue with gender liaison officers working directly with the Commission.

The University now had a special centre on women's issues, which issued a certificate of higher studies at the level of a master's degree.
34. Part of the programme of changing stereotypes with regard to women was directed at preachers and imams.
The Ministry of Islamic Affairs was trying to develop a guide for preachers and imams in mosques and to introduce the concepts of women's rights and gender equality to them.
There were, in fact, a large number of women preachers and also large numbers of women in the faculties of sharia law at Jordanian universities, which encouraged an emphasis on the rights of women in Islam.
The coalition of women's committees, and other organizations, were also working to change stereotypes, especially in rural areas.

35. Use was also being made of the mass media to make people aware that women could work side-by-side with men, as partners whether at home or outside.
Programmes in the visual media emphasized that, in some fields where women had not usually been found, they were now working with success, and at the same time reconciling their work with their roles as mothers and wives.
Those ideas were also communicated to young men and women through centres for young people, with emphasis on the role that young women themselves could play in working to eliminate stereotypes.
36. Ms. Gabr asked which reservations might be withdrawn in the future.
37. Ms. Chutikul enquired which specific agency was responsible for anti-trafficking work and whether the Government of Jordan really recognized trafficking and prostitution as problems.

38. Mr. Touq (Jordan) pointed out that he had not said that Jordan would lift one or other of the reservations, but rather had indicated that there were legal developments in progress that might make one of them redundant.
If the Government were to decide formally to lift one of the reservations, under the Constitution the whole issue of the Convention would have to go back to Parliament for consideration, which would open a Pandora's box.
Therefore no steps should be taken that might endanger the whole process.

Anti-trafficking work was the purview of the Ministry of Justice and the police.
He also clarified that prostitution is a crime in Jordan.
Articles 7 to 9
40. Ms. Maiolo said that, while welcoming the law on quotas for women's election to the municipal councils and the draft law on quotas for Parliament, she felt that laws, although very important, were not sufficient.
As had already been said both by the delegation and by other experts, the problem lay in stereotypes.

She could not imagine that a woman, conditioned to accept that she and her family should be beaten by her husband, would ever be able to conceive of herself as being competent to stand for election.
The Committee welcomed what it had heard about Jordan's programmes of awareness-raising directed at women and girls, making use of television programmes and so on.

Jordan should also indicate whether there was a time frame for bringing in the higher quota, and whether the quota system would be based on the principle of proportional representation of women from all parts of the country.
42. With regard to women's access to appointed posts, there was evidence of political will to open doors for women to reach high-ranking and decision-making positions in the Government, the judiciary, the diplomatic corps and other public institutions, but the country report itself acknowledged that their participation in political and public decision-making did not correspond to the capacities and potential of Jordanian women.
By ratifying the Convention, however, the Government had committed itself to accepting the right of Jordanian women to reach their full capacities and potential.
Therefore, more aggressive interventions by the Government were needed, both in appointing more women to government positions and in influencing the perception of the general public regarding the role of women in decision-making.
43. Ms. Gaspard, noting that women were still severely underrepresented in political and public decision-making bodies in Jordan, asked whether it was envisaged that the 20 per cent quota for the number of women in municipal councils would be increased in the future.

44. The number of women in Parliament must also increase.
A European Union study had shown that, where quotas for the number of women in municipal councils had been introduced, the women elected had helped to improve local life by bringing new issues to the political agenda, such as the need for day-care provision and family-friendly working hours.
Women could help bring about such improvements at the national level too.

The same issue had been resolved successfully in other Arab countries, although she acknowledged the current difficulties that prevented Jordan from giving its full attention to the problem.
46. Noting that, in humanitarian or special cases, a passport could be issued for a period of five years -- which made it easier for a Jordanian woman married to a non-Jordanian to obtain passports for her children in special circumstances -- she asked how many people had been issued with passports under that provision.
The Committee also wished to know what measures were in place to provide such children with access to schools and universities and to ensure their freedom of movement.
Lastly, she had information that foreign men married to Jordanian women were obliged to leave the country every three months in order to obtain a new visa.
The State party should indicate whether any measures were in place to allow such men freedom of movement.

47. Mr. Touq (Jordan), responding to Ms. Maiolo's comments, said that he could not provide specific statistics on the number of battered women in Jordan, but was certain that the number was insignificant and would thus compare favourably with that of many other countries.

LETTER DATED 25 MARCH 1995 FROM THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
ADDRESSED TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL
By its resolution 976 (1995) of 8 February 1995, the Security Council decided that the deployment of infantry units to the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III) would take place on the basis of my informing the Council that the conditions contained in paragraph 32 of my report of 1 February (S/1995/97 and Add.1) had been met.
In my further report to the Council of 5 March (S/1995/177), I indicated that in view of inescapable logistic constraints, this could be achieved only if I was in a position to notify the Council by 25 March 1995 that the parties had substantially complied with the above-mentioned conditions, which include the effective cessation of hostilities, provision of all relevant military data, and designation of all quartering areas.
In a statement issued on 10 March (S/PRST/1995/11), the Council took note of my intention in this regard.

Both President dos Santos and Mr. Savimbi assured my Special Adviser that they are fully committed to the implementation of the Lusaka Protocol and are strongly in favour of the accelerated deployment of all United Nations troops.
Mr. Kittani has also reported to me that, while the conditions stipulated in Security Council resolution 976 (1995) have not been fully met, some progress has recently been made in the effective cessation of hostilities, the disengagement of troops, the establishment of verification mechanisms, the modalities for integration of military forces, and other essential tasks.
Moreover, it is clear that it is becoming increasingly necessary to assist the parties in overcoming their mutual mistrust and to create additional impetus to the peace process.
In light of the above, and with a view to avoiding dangerous delays in the implementation of the Lusaka Protocol which might destabilize conditions on the ground, I have decided that it would be in the best interest of the peace process to proceed with preparations for the deployment of United Nations infantry units to Angola.
I fully realize that there are certain risks involved in the above decision.
As a result of the brief suspension of preparations for the deployment of United Nations troops to allow a reassessment of the situation, it is already slightly behind the original schedule.

11. The exploitation of children, child trafficking and hazardous child labour were condemned by many speakers.
Governments were urged to ratify the optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and pornography, in order to ensure accountability for these crimes.
The sexual abuse of children, which was a problem all over the world, required greater cooperation with the police.
The Director-General of the International Labour Organization, Juan Somavia, said that 180 million children are involved in the worst forms of child labour.
Many of them work because their parents are unable to earn enough.

Before making our detailed comments, we should like to extend our congratulations to UNCITRAL, particularly the members of the Secretariat, for the work that they have done.
These documents -- A/CN.9/WG.V/WP.97 and the two addenda -- constitute an excellent text that adds to the body of materials provided by the Commission for the benefit of the international community in the area of insolvency; it is particularly important at this time, given the current credit restrictions worldwide and their consequences.
In particular, the judicial materials to which our comments refer, relating to the Model Law, the UNCITRAL Legislative Guide on Insolvency Law and the UNCITRAL Practice Guide on Cross-Border Insolvency Cooperation, fill in the gaps in the range of useful texts and will help bring about a general reform of insolvency law in a number of countries.
As a general observation, the Secretariat must be congratulated on the judicial approach adopted and maintained throughout document A/CN.9/WG.V/WP.97.

Thus, in paragraph 64, the phrase "members of groups of companies" could be rather "members of enterprise groups", a form of words that is commoner in the Practice Guide.
The rest of our comments, of which there are few, relate to the advisability of aligning some terms in the Spanish text with those used in the English.
Specifically, since search tools make for easier reference, it would be better to write "bienes y derechos" wherever the English version has "assets", or "entidad" or "compañía" where the English has "company" or "corporation".
The phrase "corporate debtor" would thus always appear as "entidad deudora" or "compañía deudora" (see paras. 34, 59 and 75, among others).
Similarly, there could be "entidad fantasma" or "compañía fantasma", but not "empresa fantasma" (para. 85) and "entidad filial" or "compañía filial" (para. 82).

The same applies to the contrast drawn in paragraph 67, where the Spanish text should use the phrase "(social o individual)" in referring to a debtor.

Upon the instruction of my Government, I have the honour to write to you regarding the report submitted by the Representative of the Secretary-General on human rights of internally displaced persons, Walter Kälin (A/HRC/4/38), to the fourth session of the Human Rights Council.
I would like to draw your attention to the section of the report relating to the follow-up action to his visit, in which an incorrect reference was made to "Montenegro and Kosovo" (paras. 27-31).

I would like to draw your attention to the section of the report relating to the follow-up action to his visit, in which an incorrect reference was made to "Montenegro and Kosovo" (paras. 27-31).
First, I would like to call attention to the fact that the follow-up was actually to the visit to Serbia and Montenegro made in June 2005, as correctly referred to in the first sentence of the follow-up (para. 27).
Consequently, the relevant chapter should bear the heading "Serbia and Montenegro".
I would also like to point out the improper use of the term "Kosovo" throughout the remainder of the text on the follow-up action, which is inconsistent with the Security Council resolution 1244 (1999).

Combined second to fourth periodic reports of Guinea-Bissau (continued) (CRC/C/GNB/2-4; CRC/C/GNB/Q/2-4)
1. At the invitation of the Chairperson, the delegation of Guinea-Bissau took places at the Committee table.
2. Mr. Alves (Guinea-Bissau) said that there was a degree of mistrust surrounding adoption and that orphans tended to be placed in the care of their extended families.
The Government was not averse to ratifying the Convention on Protection of Children and Cooperation in respect of Intercountry Adoption, but that implied strengthening the adoption monitoring and regulatory system, which would take time.
3. Mr. Kotrane, supported by Ms. Wijemanne, expressed concern about the risk of trafficking linked to unregulated child placement.

A judicial oversight body and social services should be established to follow up on children in alternative care and ensure that they were not exploited or mistreated.
4. Mr. Alves (Guinea-Bissau) agreed that such a body was necessary, but lamented that the fragility of public institutions, the permeability of borders and the lack of political will made it currently impossible to establish a reliable adoption oversight system.
However, the Committee's recommendations would be closely examined by the relevant authorities.

5. There was no conflict between customary law -- in other words, local courts -- and State justice, as they were very distinct systems.
Local courts, in which traditional leaders were involved, had jurisdiction over minor disputes, while family disputes were heard by first-instance courts, which were part of the State justice system.
6. The age of criminal responsibility was 16 years, but there were as yet no institutions for minors in conflict with the law; their care was therefore often left to NGOs.
The authorities were aware that the situation was not ideal and were attempting to remedy it.

14. Mr. Correia Gomes Fernandes (Guinea-Bissau) replied that children elected to the Children's Parliament met at the National People's Assembly, where their opinions and concerns were heard and heeded.
The Children's Parliament had its own budget, funded through that of the National People's Assembly.
15. Since 2000, birth certificates could be issued for children aged 0 to 7.
In 2013, a central registrar's office had been established to facilitate the registration of children within five months of birth.
In addition, the regional branches set up in all nine regions had made it easier for parents to declare their children's birth, hence the spike in the number of registered children.

17. Mr. Correia Gomes Fernandes (Guinea-Bissau) said that he did not have specific statistics, but would ensure that the Committee received them in due course.
18. The Criminal Code did not explicitly define paedophilia because the problem had scarcely been recognized when it had been drafted.
Although infanticide was prohibited under article 110 of the Code, it still occurred in certain communities, particularly in the case of children with disabilities.

A number of treaty bodies had already made similar recommendations, which had not been implemented for lack of resources.
26. Mr. Correia Gomes Fernandes (Guinea-Bissau) said that children aged 14 or over were permitted to work a maximum of four hours per day, provided that the work did not jeopardize their physical development or their education.
The National Commission for the Abolition of Child Labour, a tripartite body on which the Ministry of Labour, trade unions and civil society were represented, was mapping child labour with a view to formulating a strategy targeting the regions and types of employment where the problem was most acute.
27. In the capital, measures had been taken in conjunction with a Muslim association to locate the families of the many foreign children sent to Guinea-Bissau to receive a Koranic education and ended up begging on the streets.
28. Ms. Wijemanne commended the State party for ratifying International Labour Organization (ILO) Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999 (No. 182) and ILO Minimum Age Convention, 1973 (No. 138).

31. Ms. Có Mendes Sanha (Guinea-Bissau) said that primary education was free and that the Government was not aware of any payment of unofficial fees.
The Government was making massive investments in school infrastructure, which was currently inadequate.
All newly built schools had running water and main drainage and could accommodate children with disabilities.
The school meal programmes put in place had had a noticeable impact on the enrolment of girls.
Scholarships were also awarded to keep girls with disabilities and good academic records in school.

41. Mr. Cardona Llorens wished to know whether the State party intended to encourage the inclusion of children with disabilities in mainstream schools.
42. Ms. Có Mendes Sanha (Guinea-Bissau) said that the Government had made the inclusion of children with disabilities in schools one of its priorities, but lacked both the human and financial resources to put it into practice, which explained why they were still placed in specialized institutions.
43. Mr. Correia Gomes Fernandes (Guinea-Bissau) said that funds to support associations for persons with disabilities were also lacking.
44. The State party had not undertaken a detailed study of the murder of children accused of witchcraft, but infanticide was explicitly prohibited under article 110 of the Criminal Code.
45. Mr. Alves (Guinea-Bissau) said that the 2011 negotiations with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund had resulted in 1 billion dollars in debt relief, but that relations with the Bretton Woods institutions had been suspended since the 2012 coup d'état.

He could not say toward what the savings had been put, although the Government was prioritizing health and education.
46. Ms. Aidoo proposed that, once relations with those institutions were re-established, the State party should focus on child protection, an area often overlooked in social policies.
47. Mr. Alves (Guinea-Bissau) assured the Committee that the proposal would be conveyed to the relevant authorities.

It was therefore crucial that they were systematically brought before the courts so that the customary practice could be eventually abandoned altogether.
49. Ms. Có Mendes Sanha (Guinea-Bissau) said that the Civil Code prohibited all discrimination in inheritance matters between legitimate children and children born out of wedlock, but that discrimination was still pronounced in rural areas, where State presence was relatively weak.

However, there is parity in primary school attendance, with 84 per cent of girls attending primary school, compared to 80 per cent of boys.
6. The Government conducted the last census in 1998.
The next census is planned for 2008.
The Malawi socio-economic database, currently in its final stages of development, will provide opportunities to assemble and update vital statistics.
However, the availability of updated, disaggregated data for development remains a challenge.

Implementation of these policies and plans remains a challenge, due to inadequate human resource capacity, especially in the Government.
12. Lessons from the fifth country programme include: (a) strengthening national capacity is vital for delivering high-quality reproductive health care and integrated HIV preventive services; (b) to effectively implement policy guidelines and implementation frameworks, there is a need to strengthen national systems; and (c) programmes to reduce maternal mortality need to address all levels of care, from community clinics to referral facilities.

2. Indigenous peoples lived on their land before settlers moved in as a result of conquest, occupation, colonization, etc.
Whenever dominating peoples extended their territory or settlers took new lands by force, the livelihoods and very existence of indigenous populations were endangered. GE.03-14708 (E) 300603 070703
3. During the periods of conquest and colonization, these populations were dispossessed of their entire livelihoods, especially their lands.
The current situation of these peoples, formerly termed "natives", is a legacy of colonial history.
The treaties and conventions imposed on native peoples by the colonizers were nothing short of acts of dispossession of these peoples for the benefit of settlers, who received protection and assistance from their State of origin.

4. Today the colonial usurpation of the land of indigenous peoples and their enslavement are cited to explain the extreme poverty in which they live.
The law of the colonizing States followed a logic of domination and repression.
European expansion and the emergence of empires following the industrial revolution of the eighteenth century impelled the colonial Powers to seek out markets and resources on every continent.
5. The right to dominate had created a sphere of action in which settlers evaded all forms of justice or punishment, with confiscation transformed into right of ownership with all that this entails.
This grabbing of the riches of indigenous populations endured for nearly 300 years in Africa.

9. Indigenous people also find in this natural environment the medicines they need for their health and that of the animals they have managed to domesticate.
The right to a wholesome environment, to health, food and housing - i.e. rights without which a person descends into extreme poverty - have always ensured that the indigenous population enjoys security and stability.

12. Transnational corporations care nothing for repairing the destruction they wreak.
Corporations, States and the international community alike should recognize the negative consequences of economic activities and impose a code of conduct upon all those who play an economic role.
The deterioration of the natural environment has endangered the quality of life in every country in the world, particularly in areas inhabited by indigenous populations.
Environmental pollution has dangerously compromised the enjoyment of important economic, social and cultural rights of these populations.

Indigenous or native peoples lived on their land before settlers arrived and acquired dominance through conquest, occupation, colonization, etc.
15. Whenever dominating peoples extended their territory or settlers took new lands by force, the crops, livelihoods and very existence of indigenous populations were endangered.
The threats to the crops and land of indigenous peoples, and to their status and other rights as groups and citizens, take different forms and do not necessarily lead to the same results.
16. All this is a consequence of colonial history.
The treaties concluded between the colonizers and the colonized were simply acts of dispossession for the benefit of the colonizer.

The treaties concluded between the colonizers and the colonized were simply acts of dispossession for the benefit of the colonizer.
When the former colonies gained their international sovereignty, they perpetuated the former system of exploitation of the land belonging to the indigenous people by concluding agreements with the former settlers involving dispossession with practically no compensation.
17. The indigenous populations have often sought, since the birth of the new nations, to preserve their identity and their land.
The relationship between the indigenous people and the land is the core of its heritage and its existence.
19. The provisions of former law, essentially comprising imposed treaties, should be repealed in their entirety and replaced by fairer and more equitable legislation which better protects the interests of the indigenous populations.

20. Globalization is a new modus operandi of world capitalism, which supports the emergence of globalized firms that pursue a global approach to the design, production and distribution of their goods and services.

The relationship between indigenous peoples and their land embodies fundamental rights that are simultaneously legal, economic and social in nature and form part and parcel of their identity.
It is in the context of this relationship that fishing, gathering and farming - which have always enabled these peoples to live and survive - must be understood.
It is this relationship which, in the past, has also enabled these peoples to exercise sovereignty over the resources and natural wealth on and in their land.
23. Globalization is a system in which States are weakened to an extent which even affects the exercise of their sovereignty, and where real and undivided power resides in private economic power alone.
The search for this power has resulted in the confiscation of croplands and other resources that used to belong to indigenous populations, and this pattern has survived the various phases of decolonization.

24. Land law was drawn up by and for the benefit of the colonial Powers, who left no room for the rights of the indigenous populations in the essentially one-sided treaties they imposed on the subjugated chieftains.
Land acquired in this manner is exploited in an uncontrolled manner by the rich and powerful; the indigenous populations are excluded, unable to claim even the smallest share of the huge revenues derived from its exploitation.
We Africans retain bitter memories of the experience of the Ogoni people in Nigeria, some of whom were sentenced to death and executed for having claimed their share of the wealth derived from the crude oil under their land. For some time now, the Bororo people of Cameroon have been unsuccessfully trying to block the passage across their crop and grazing lands of a pipeline that will make it easier to tap the country's oil wealth.

The rights of peoples considered both individually and collectively must be taken into account in all actions intended to encourage the development of these peoples.

Indigenous populations must be able to use and develop the land on which they live and to be protected against encroachments.
When the commercial use of natural resources (forests, minerals or hydrocarbons) occurs on land belonging to or habitually used by indigenous populations, they should be informed of their rights and the potential impact of the planned exploitation, and be involved in decision-making regarding the planned commercial use.
27. In many countries, land set aside for parks and protected areas may encroach upon and often swallow all the land reserved for indigenous populations, without any compensation being provided.
C. Poverty among indigenous people
28. Indigenous populations, which international institutions recognize as being the most vulnerable and excluded, are naturally the poorest, living as they do in the most wretched penury without hope of a future for themselves or their descendants.

The timber industries that exploit these forests are absolutely oblivious to the rights of these populations.
In African forests, each decision to cede the forest homes of indigenous populations to transnational private companies, without taking account of their rights, already constitutes a violation of their fundamental rights, for example their rights connected with their land.
The raison d'être of private corporations, namely maximum profit at minimum cost, is incompatible with respect for the rights of indigenous populations.
This is the lesson we learn from the history of colonization, which was pursued while completely ignoring the rules of the indigenous natural environment.
30. The principal consequence of all this is the accelerated and chronic pauperization of indigenous populations, who now live in the most abject poverty for which the international community is largely to blame through the intermediary of its finance institutions.

It is superfluous to state that women and children are the principal victims.
31. Indigenous populations, robbed of their land and vanquished by the indiscriminate law of the market economy, are choosing the path of exile in search of decent living conditions. Others have been reduced to a state of agricultural or industrial slavery, or seek work in mines for starvation wages or as porters in the towns, where they earn a pittance.
32. According to the Human Development Report 1990 published by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), 90 per cent of farmers own barely 11 per cent of cropland, whereas 10 per cent of the new rich own the remaining 89 per cent.
The globalization of the economy, driven solely by the profit motive and chiefly by transnational corporations, the World Trade Organization and the international financial institutions - a process which has no social dimension - overlooks the needs, prerogatives and rights of indigenous populations.

The law provides that, in such a case, the judge may confine himself to an "abridged judgment" (verkort vonnis), which does not need to be supplemented with evidence or a statement listing the items of evidence, and a trial transcript is not required to be produced.
2.3 The parliamentary history of the process of drafting article 410a of the Netherlands Code of Criminal Procedure states expressly that in cases such as the author's, no supplementation will take place with evidence on which the decision was based in the first instance or with a transcript of the trial in the first instance, neither upon pronouncing the judgment nor after lodging an appeal.
That rule was motivated by an effort to save costs.

6.4 The Committee considers that the author has sufficiently substantiated his allegations under article 14, paragraph 5, and article 2, paragraph 3, of the Covenant and therefore proceeds to their consideration on the merits.
Consideration of the merits
7.1 The Human Rights Committee has considered the present communication in the light of all the information made available to it by the parties, as required under article 5, paragraph 1, of the Optional Protocol.
In the absence of a motivated judgment, a trial transcript or even a list of the evidence used, the author was, therefore, not provided in the circumstances of this case with the facilities necessary for the proper preparation of his appeal.
7.3 The Committee further notes that the State party has accepted that a violation of article 14, paragraph 5, of the Covenant occurred in that the Court of Appeal denied his application for leave to appeal with the motivation that a hearing of the appeal was not in the interests of the proper administration of justice.
The Committee considers that article 14, paragraph 5, of the Covenant requires a review by a higher tribunal of a criminal conviction and sentence.
Any such review, in the context of a decision regarding a leave to appeal, must be examined on its merits, taking into consideration the evidence presented before the first instance judge, and the conduct of the trial on the basis of the legal provisions applicable to the case in question.
7.4 Accordingly, in the specific circumstances, the Committee finds that the right to appeal of the author under article 14, paragraph 5, of the Covenant has been violated, due to the failure of the State party to provide adequate facilities for the preparation of his appeal and conditions for a genuine review of his case by a higher tribunal.

9. In accordance with article 2, paragraph 3 (a), of the Covenant, the State party is under an obligation to provide the author with an effective remedy.
The Committee takes note of the author's assertion that the financial compensation of EUR 1,000 proposed by the State party does not constitute an effective remedy because it does not provide for a review of the criminal sentence and conviction adopted against the author, and it does not remedy the harm to his reputation.
The Committee considers that, in this case, an effective remedy will allow a review of the author's conviction and sentence by a higher tribunal, or implementation of other appropriate measures capable of removing the adverse effects caused to the author, together with adequate compensation.
The Committee also considers that the State party should bring the relevant legal framework into conformity with the requirements of article 14, paragraph 5, of the Covenant.
The State party is also under an obligation to prevent similar violations in the future.

A climate of suspicion, rumour and conspiracy theory exists in Guyana which has been fuelled by exceptionally violent incidents in 2008.
Two separate and conflicting narratives and perceptions of reality have emerged among Afro- and Indo-Guyanese, which threaten to undermine shared values and common goals that are essential to a united, prosperous Guyana.
The independent expert recognizes commendable steps on the part of the Government to date to address issues of ethnic tensions, criminal activities and economic underdevelopment.
However, further effective action is required urgently to restore confidence in good governance and the rule of law among all communities, and prevent an inexorable slide into further polarization and possible violence.
A new era of political will and strong, visionary leadership is required to realize change and reverse the economic and social stagnation that is evident in a divided Guyana.

Derogatory stereotypes of criminality colour wider societal perceptions of Afro-Guyanese individuals and communities.
Particular challenges affect women from minority communities, including a scarcity of employment opportunities for women from Afro-Guyanese communities, the extremely heavy burden of care shouldered by single mothers, and a disturbing culture of domestic violence, often fuelled by poverty and unemployment in their communities.
Women feel that domestic violence cases are not treated seriously by the criminal justice system.
Additionally, women's participation in political processes remains well below levels of equality.
Current anti-discrimination legislation and policies are insufficient to address discrimination, exclusion and ethnically based bias.

2. Together with other agencies in the United Nations system, UNHCR had previously undertaken joint evaluations in operations of mutual concern.
Some of those evaluations were found to be rather too complex to manage and, as a result, less attention was paid to developing this tool of effective inter-agency collaboration further.
However, joint evaluations have met with increasing interest of late and several new projects were launched recently.
3. Together with the Evaluation Service of the World Food Programme (WFP), EPAU recently commenced a joint evaluation of the five pilot countries in which WFP has taken responsibility for food distribution to refugee beneficiaries.
A team of two consultants is scheduled to visit all five pilot countries and will ultimately produce an assessment of the effectiveness of this arrangement, not only in terms of cost efficiency but also with respect to protection concerns related to food distribution.

An evaluation team is expected to begin its research in autumn 2004.
Continued focus on the utilization of evaluation findings
7. The findings from the three large thematic evaluations concluded in 2002 on Refugee Children, Refugee Women, and the Community Services function have prompted UNHCR to dedicate staff and resources to ensure that recommendations contained in these reports are followed up consistently.
Many recommendations have indeed informed changes to operational policies and respective implementation procedures.
EPAU places an increasingly high value on maintaining a strong utilization focus from the very inception of an evaluation project.

11. EPAU continues to pursue the concept of Real-Time Evaluations (RTE) as a rapid learning tool for rapidly evolving refugee operations.
Unlike traditional evaluations, an RTE allows for immediate feedback into operational management.
12. Following the return of United Nations staff to Monrovia in September 2003, EPAU fielded an RTE team to evaluate the immediate operational issues with which UNHCR was confronted in Liberia.
Against the backdrop of an operation severely affected by the security environment outside the capital, ongoing assistance to IDPs was a major focus for the international community.
The evaluation highlighted the complexity of inter-agency coordination, particularly in the area of protection.

15. As a follow-up to the Protracted Refugee Situation (PRS) study, EPAU has taken on the "Livelihood Project" which will be looking into livelihood options amongst refugees, returnees and members of host communities.
Based on a recognition that insufficient baseline data was available on the concept of refugee livelihoods, this project was conceived to provide an evidence-based analysis which in turn could inform the design and implementation of livelihood interventions.
16. In the light of the High Commissioner's "Framework for durable solutions for refugees and persons of concern", the Livelihood Project emphasizes the importance of self-reliance and livelihoods for refugees, both to improve the quality of their life during their period of asylum and to prepare them better for their eventual reintegration.
The project comprises a literature review and several case studies, of which the following five have been finalized: Congolese refugees in Gabon; Sierra Leonean and Casamance refugees in the Gambia; Mozambican refugees in South Africa; Somali refugees in Egypt and Sudanese refugees in Ethiopia.
17. As part of the Livelihood Project, EPAU has initiated the refugee livelihoods network, an interactive electronic network comprising UNHCR staff, consultants and researchers with a common interest in refugee livelihoods and self-reliance issues.

20. A recent analysis revealed that UNHCR currently has approximately 9000 vehicles of different specifications on its active inventory, with a purchase value of some $220 million.
The 2003 evaluation of the community services function in UNHCR raised the question to what extent these vehicles directly benefit refugees.
A joint EPAU/Supply Management Service (SMS) team has begun analysing this issue and will travel to the Balkans, Africa and Asia to evaluate how well UNHCR selects, maintains and manages this large investment.
Building capacity through training
21. In order to promote the development of the evaluation function in UNHCR further, EPAU organized a two-day Evaluation Training Workshop in March 2004.

In addition to these strengthening measures, the Government must be modernized so that these laws can be enforced and efficient accountability arrangements put in place.
II. Past cooperation and lessons learned
The UNDP Office's support activity was crucial with regard to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
The Dominican Republic was the only middle-income country to be selected for the Millennium Project as a pilot country for a needs and cost assessment.
The UNDP Office, together with the other agencies of the United Nations system represented in the country, supported the Presidential Commission on the Millennium Development Goals and Sustainable Development (COPDES) in the coordination of the preparatory process for the first needs assessment and cost analysis for attainment of the MDGs by 2015.

It should be noted that it was possible to create, apply and validate an assessment methodology of proven effectiveness at the provincial level.
8. The UNDP Office helped with national capacity-building for the formulation and pursuit of government policies geared to the achievement of the MDGs and nation-wide poverty analysis by the National Planning Office (ONAPLAN), and by supporting the design of a Standardized System of Beneficiaries (SIUBEN) to provide an individual focus and of ground-breaking programmes such as "Eating first" and "Incentives for school attendance".
In addition, an "Atlas of Dominican poverty" was prepared in cooperation with the World Bank and ONAPLAN.

10. With regard to the environment and disaster management, continuing support was provided for the programmes for modernization of the National System of Protected Areas, and for the decentralization of management of its components and linking of these processes in neighbouring communities.
The action taken by UNDP in conjunction with civil society organizations allowed a rapid and targeted response to mitigate the damage caused by the successive natural disasters that occurred in the south (Jimaní, 2004) and north of the country (2005).
11. Support was provided to the Presidential AIDS Council (COPRESIDA) for the updating of the National Strategic Plan and national and local capacity-building for the implementation of programmes to prevent and combat HIV/AIDS.
12. It was considered important to identify the key players or entities prior to programme formulation, so as to maximize results and guarantee long-term impact by creating effective links between central and local government agencies, civil society organizations and grassroots organizations directly involved in the programmes.
The empowerment of all the sectors concerned and their involvement in the projects and programmes were decisive in order to guarantee the best results.

The UNDP Office understands that its success or failure depends basically on the effective participation of civil society organizations in the formulation, design and application of strategies and programmes for national and local capacity-building.
Interagency participation will be encouraged in order to minimize costs and avoid duplication of effort, and in order to share enriching experiences to promote the attainment of the goals set.
IV. Programme management, monitoring and evaluation
20. For most of its cooperation activities in the Dominican Republic, the UNDP Office will adopt the modality of national execution.
However, as regards disaster prevention and environmental management, at the request of the Dominican Government and because the country does not yet have the necessary arrangements in place, the UNDP Office will act as executing agency for some projects.

Indeed, from 2000 to 2013, the ratio of private credit to gross domestic product (GDP) increased from an average of 19 per cent to 33 per cent in low-income countries, and from 52 per cent to 82 per cent in middle-income countries.
Nonetheless, in many developing countries, especially low-income countries, commercial banks remain the main provider of credit, and private bond markets are underdeveloped or non-existent.
For example, while private debt securities represent an average of 34 per cent of GDP in high-income countries, their share is only 9 per cent in middle-income countries, and are close to zero in low-income countries.
5. Deeper capital markets should provide a conduit for the long-term investment necessary for sustainable development.
Nonetheless, there is a risk that such nascent markets will attract international speculative capital, leading to short-term bubbles, which can reverse when global investor sentiment changes, causing shocks to the real economy.

It is therefore important for countries to design a strong macroprudential regulatory framework, potentially in conjunction with capital-account management.
6. A domestic institutional investor base (including, for example, domestic pension funds, insurance companies and sovereign wealth funds) could provide a more stable source of investment.
The presence of institutional investors in developing countries is still significantly lower than in high-income countries.

In particular, financial instability and risk have been found to increase with financial sector depth.
One possible explanation is that the growth in credit may not be sufficiently directed towards productive investments, which is linked to an increasingly short-term orientation of financial markets.
9. Deepening of financial sectors is also frequently associated with more financial inclusiveness.
Globally, 2.5 billion adults do not have access to formal financial services, with the percentage of adults with at least one account at a formal financial institution at around 90 per cent in high-income countries, but only around 57 per cent in upper middle-income countries, 28 per cent in lower middle-income countries and 24 per cent in low-income countries, as of 2012.
Furthermore, it has been suggested that about 200 million small and medium-sized enterprises in developing and emerging markets lack adequate financing.
In particular, financial instability and risk have been found to increase with financial sector depth.
One possible explanation is that the growth in credit may not be sufficiently directed towards productive investments, which is linked to an increasingly short-term orientation of financial markets.
9. Deepening of financial sectors is also frequently associated with more financial inclusiveness.

Though more needs to be done, many developing countries have made progress in that respect, especially in the area of legal and regulatory reform, improving the provision of information and promoting the ease of doing business.
For example, since 2005, the average time to start a business has fallen from 50 to 30 days, with the average falling by half in low-income countries.
11. Ultimately, domestic resource mobilization will be driven by inclusive and sustained economic growth, underscoring the importance of effective domestic macroeconomic policymaking.
To achieve sustainable development, policies should link economic and social considerations, along with the mobilization of resources and more efficient public spending, to ensure access to basic economic and social infrastructure.
The Monterrey Consensus stressed the need for raising public resources.

12. With regard to the capacity to raise public revenues, a significant gap remains between developed and developing countries.
In 2008, the tax-to-GDP ratio was 34.5 per cent for countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), compared to 17 per cent for low-income countries, though the OECD rate fell somewhat, to 33.8 per cent, in 2010 (updated data was not available for low-income countries).
Most OECD countries' tax systems make use of a diverse mix of direct and indirect taxes. Relying on a range of taxes is economically efficient because the marginal cost of collecting any type of tax increases disproportionally after reaching a certain threshold, especially in the context of weak tax administrations.
In many developing countries, tax systems tend to rely on a narrow set of taxes, though those vary depending on geography and resource endowment.

Different components of illicit financial flows such as tax evasion and avoidance, trade mispricing and transfer mispricing unfairly deprive countries of tax revenue.
For example, trade mispricing is an illegal arrangement in which imports are overinvoiced and/or exports are underinvoiced with the intent to evade taxes.
Transfer pricing refers to the mechanism by which cross-border intragroup transactions are priced.
This is in itself a normal part of how a multinational enterprise operates.
If the intracompany price does not reflect the true value, however, profits might effectively be shifted to low-tax or no-tax jurisdictions, while losses and deductions are shifted to high-tax jurisdictions.

Although the challenges related to transfer pricing are the same for developed and developing countries, developing countries are often less well-equipped to deal with them.
For this reason, the Committee of Experts on International Cooperation in Tax Matters has developed the United Nations Practical Manual on Transfer Pricing for Developing Countries.
17. Tax evasion and avoidance are best countered by well-resourced and independent revenue authorities, and trade mispricing by functioning customs authorities.
For resource-rich countries, transparency in the extractive industries, especially during contract negotiations, is pivotal in ensuring that economic activities by multinational enterprises are taxed appropriately.
Countries should cooperate to ensure that the pressure of multinational enterprises for favourable fiscal regimes for the extractive industries does not turn into a so-called "race to the bottom".

Given the cross-border nature of most illicit financial flows, strengthened anti-money laundering measures are needed, as well as mutual legal assistance and exchange of information between countries.
During the most recent meeting of the Group of Eight, the participating countries concluded that "developing countries should have the information and capacity to collect taxes owed them -- and other countries have a duty to help them".
The finance ministers of the Group of 20 echoed that sentiment and reiterated their commitment to extend the practice of automatic exchange of information.
18. The Monterrey Consensus stresses the importance of private international capital flows, particularly foreign direct investment (FDI), for national and international development efforts.
That was reiterated in the Doha Declaration, which emphasized the need for international private investment to achieve economic, social and environmental sustainable development, and reaffirmed in the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, entitled "The future we want".

20. Despite growing financing needs for sustainable development, long-term investment by international investors appears to have been declining.
Globally, FDI decreased by around 18 per cent from 2011 to 2012, though the largest drop in inflows was to developed countries.
Net FDI flows to developing countries are estimated to have fallen around 4 per cent, from $437 billion in 2011 to approximately $419 billion in 2012, with inflows to developing countries for the first time larger than inflows to developed countries.
21. Despite the overall drop in FDI globally, FDI to least developed countries increased by 20 per cent in 2012.
FDI still comprises the dominant share of private capital flows to least developed countries.

FDI to least developed countries remains concentrated in a few countries and regions.
Flows to Africa, though higher than a decade ago, remain limited; the inflows are still concentrated in resource-rich countries.
Recently, there has also been an increase in the share of greenfield investment directed at manufacturing and services in least developed countries, with 28 per cent of greenfield investment in least developed countries going to infrastructure.

22. One concern, however, is that there has been an increase in financial FDI at the expense of more stable greenfield investment.
For example, there appears to have been a shift in the composition of FDI from equity to debt components.
As became clear during the financial crisis, when a significant portion of FDI is invested in intracompany debt, the parent company can recall that debt on short notice.

It is therefore important that policymakers are cognizant of the shorter-term investments included in FDI statistics, which could reverse more quickly than expected in an uncertain economic and financial climate.
23. Outward FDI from developing and transition economies has become increasingly significant, reaching 31 per cent of the world total in 2012.
A large proportion has been directed towards other developing and transition economies.
Outward FDI from Asian countries accounts for nearly three quarters of outward FDI from developing countries, primarily driven by outflows from China.
FDI outflows from Africa, however, nearly tripled in 2012, driven by outflows from South Africa.

24. The scope for development-enhancing investment arising from South-South FDI is increased by the fact that the technology and skills of multinational enterprises in developing countries are often closer to those used by firms in host countries.
In general, technologies for similar emerging economies are easier to diffuse, as local firms are able to absorb them more effectively.
25. More broadly, one of the benefits of FDI over other forms of inflows is its potential to transfer knowledge and technology.
Empirical evidence for the effectiveness of knowledge spillovers from FDI is mixed, however.

Indeed, the total international claims of European banks, including all cross-border and local claims in foreign currency, having a maturity of over two years have been falling, and there is evidence that lending to emerging-market economies has been reallocated towards shorter maturities.
31. The Monterrey Consensus and the Doha Declaration also stress the importance of remittances for development.
Official recording estimates that international remittance flows to developing countries totalled $401 billion in 2012, far exceeding official development assistance.
India, China, the Philippines and Mexico remain the largest recipients of migrant remittances, though smaller developing countries, such as Tajikistan, Liberia, Kyrgyzstan, Lesotho and the Republic of Moldova receive the most as a share of GDP.
The high growth in remittances during the past decade highlights the important role of diaspora communities as providers of a critical source of foreign-exchange earnings.

World trade grew by only 20 per cent, down from 5.2 per cent in 2011, and trade growth is expected to remain sluggish, at 3.3 per cent, in 2013.
The deceleration is associated with weakening demand, in particular in developed countries.

As many developing countries are increasingly integrated in global networks of production and trade, however, they are increasingly feeling the effects of the global slowdown.
East Asian countries in particular saw their exports decline in much of 2012, while many emerging economies and primary commodity-exporting countries registered export declines in the second half of 2012.
Least developed countries experienced a slight fall in their share in global trade, which remains low at only 1.1 per cent.
Exports from least developed countries continue to be highly concentrated, both geographically and in terms of products. Furthermore, five least developed countries account for 62 per cent of total merchandise exports.

36. Progress on development issues at the Ninth Ministerial Conference could include the setting up of a mechanism to monitor the application of the principle of special and differential treatment of developing countries, and a package specific to least developed countries. The proposal on the latter issue concerns four areas: full implementation of the Hong Kong Ministerial Declaration on duty-free and quota-free market access for products from least developed countries, preferential access for service exports from least developed countries, and an agreement on cotton.
An extension of the transition period for least developed countries to apply provision of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights until 1 July 2021 has already been agreed upon.
37. As progress on a multilateral trade system has stalled, bilateral, regional and interregional free trade agreements continue to proliferate.
Currently, 251 regional free trade agreements are operational, and more are under negotiation.
As they allow member countries to depart from the "most favoured nation" principle, they threaten to further fragment trade rules and undermine the consistency of the multilateral system.

To date, only Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden continue to exceed the United Nations target, while the United Kingdom is expected to reach it in 2013.
46. Despite difficult budgetary circumstances, some countries maintained or increased their ODA budgets in 2012.
Net ODA rose in real terms in nine countries, the largest increases recorded in Australia, Austria, Iceland, Luxembourg and the Republic of Korea.
Several donors that are not members of the Development Assistance Committee dramatically scaled up aid, including Turkey and the United Arab Emirates.
47. Overall, aid is declining just as the world commits itself to accelerating progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals by the 2015 deadline and aims at elaborating a bold post-2015 development strategy, with poverty eradication and sustainability at its core.

50. The Busan Forum commitment to improve aid predictability is unlikely to be met by the target year of 2013, in large part owing to budget cuts in donor countries.
The report of the Development Assistance Committee of OECD on predictability finds that in 2010 and 2011 donors disbursed 5 and 8 per cent less aid, respectively, than planned in 2010.
That is a marked deterioration compared to 2009.
Donor countries need to consider additional mechanisms to increase the predictability of aid flows.
51. South-South cooperation has become an increasingly important complementary source of development financing.

It is estimated that South-South development cooperation reached between $12.9 billion and $14.8 billion by 2010, and it is expected to grow further, with major increases planned by China, India and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.
Most of the resources come in the form of bilateral programmes of project funding.

This form of cooperation emphasizes common interests and partnership rather than compassion (except in cases of emergency assistance), and embraces a broader concept of development effectiveness.
A distinctive characteristic of South-South development cooperation is an integrated approach that packages commercial transactions in trade, investment and loans with unidirectional support, for example in education, health and infrastructural aid programmes.

The Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation was established in June 2012, as an outcome of the Fourth High-level Forum on Aid Effectiveness.
It has identified a set of priorities, including the interface between development cooperation and domestic resource mobilization, engaging the private sector and sharing knowledge as a form of development cooperation, and is to meet regularly at the ministerial level starting late in 2014.

53. The need for more predictable international public financing has intensified the search for new sources of development financing, both for financing social needs, particularly in least developed countries, but also for leveraging private financing for climate change and other global concerns.
The World Economic and Social Survey 2012 estimates that around $400 billion to $450 billion per year could be raised through taxes on financial transactions and carbon emissions, and through the use of the special drawing rights of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
The Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation was established in June 2012, as an outcome of the Fourth High-level Forum on Aid Effectiveness.
It has identified a set of priorities, including the interface between development cooperation and domestic resource mobilization, engaging the private sector and sharing knowledge as a form of development cooperation, and is to meet regularly at the ministerial level starting late in 2014.

These innovative mechanisms are technically feasible means to raise substantial resources in a predictable manner, and could contribute to tackling emerging global challenges; however, they are politically difficult to implement.
The use of special drawing rights in particular faces significant political but also practical and legal hurdles.

V. External debt
56. In 2012, the external debt-to-GDP ratio for developing countries averaged at 24.5 per cent and public debt-to-GDP stood at 45.9 per cent, up only slightly from 2011 and still low by historical standards.
The aggregate picture, however, hides the extent to which some developing countries remain critically indebted or are at significant risk of debt distress.
Although many low-income countries have benefited from comprehensive debt relief programmes, including the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative, sovereign debt challenges remain in some small States and low-income countries.
57. The problem is most acute among countries in the Caribbean, where extreme weather events exacerbated already weak fiscal positions in some countries.

In addition, those countries were negatively affected by the financial crisis owing to strong links with the United States and Europe, a high dependence on tourism and the erosion of trade preferences.
Furthermore, owing to slow economic growth, many small States are unlikely to simply "grow out of debt" and may need additional policy measures to reduce their debt burdens.
58. As at March 2013, 35 countries out of a total of 39 heavily indebted poor countries had reached the "completion point" (the point at which comprehensive debt relief becomes irrevocable).
In 2012 and 2013, three more countries reached the completion point under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative: the Comoros, Côte d'Ivoire and Guinea.
Chad was the only country in the interim stage between decision and completion points, and another three countries -- Eritrea, Somalia and the Sudan -- are eligible to receive debt relief.

Chad was the only country in the interim stage between decision and completion points, and another three countries -- Eritrea, Somalia and the Sudan -- are eligible to receive debt relief.
Zimbabwe, which remains in severe debt distress, could also be added to the list of eligible countries if future debt assessments confirm that it meets the indebtedness criterion and its eligibility for the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust is reinstated.
59. Increased borrowing by heavily indebted poor countries, however, including bond finance, lending from non-traditional creditors and concessional finance, is filling the newly created borrowing space.
For example, over the last couple of years, 10 African countries, including 3 low-income countries, have issued sovereign bonds on international capital markets, raising a total of $8.1 billion.
The new debt has a shorter maturity (11.2 years compared with an average maturity of 28.7 years) and higher coupon rate (of 6.2 per cent, compared with an average coupon rate of only 1.6 per cent) on outstanding foreign debt, much of which is concessional.

Analysis by the World Bank Group shows that in eight countries the ratio of public debt to GDP is already one third of the way to pre-debt relief.

In particular, there has been an increase in the share of domestic debt denominated in local currencies, which reduces currency mismatch risk for countries.
At the same time, there has been an increase in short-term debt as a proportion of GDP, possibly reflecting the shift in financing in domestic capital markets, which often lack longer-term bond markets.
61. It is clear from the ongoing discussion that, in order to enhance the role of foreign borrowing for growth and development, efforts are needed to strengthen three pillars: responsible lending and borrowing, debt management and a framework for sovereign debt restructuring.
62. Implementing well-designed and responsible debt management strategies becomes increasingly important as the range of creditors and instruments expands.
In addition, previous sovereign debt crises were characterized by creditors who lent somewhat irresponsibly to countries with weak fundamentals at relatively low interest rates.

The meeting reports include both contractual and statutory options for further discussion.
UNCTAD is currently coordinating an international working group on the creation of a debt workout mechanism, composed of prominent experts and stakeholders, to examine options for a mechanism.
IMF decided to review its sovereign debt restructuring policies and practices following the IMF Board discussion on the report entitled "Sovereign debt restructuring -- recent developments and implications for the Fund's legal and policy framework" in May 2013.
67. The international community should more actively pursue the development of an agreed approach/mechanism for sovereign debt workouts to ensure legal predictability and timely debt restructuring that include a fair burden sharing.
Convoking an international working group to examine options for enhancing the international architecture for debt restructuring may be a first step in that direction.

70. Global imbalances across major economies have narrowed since the financial crisis, but that was largely due to demand deflation in the global economy, while structural issues still remain.
Global imbalances have been interlinked with the accumulation of foreign exchange reserves, in particular in emerging and developing economies, many of which hold reserves as a form of self-insurance against high financial market volatility.
Excessive reserve accumulation is costly, however.
Most countries hold reserves in United States Treasuries and other safe assets.
As such, reserves represent a form of constrained savings that cannot be invested in sustainable development.

Furthermore, while reserves might serve as insurance for an individual country, thus reducing risks, in aggregate, they exacerbate global imbalances.
The Commission of Experts on Reforms of the International Monetary and Financial System recommended that the international reserve system make greater use of IMF special drawing rights, as they provide a low-cost alternative to accumulation of international reserves for the purpose of self-insurance.

73. The global financial crisis has revealed fundamental shortcomings of the international financial system.
In response, steps have been taken to strengthen international financial regulation, with the primary aim to ensure the safety and soundness of the financial system, centred on the banking sector through the Basel III framework. Additional measures include strengthening oversight of the shadow banking system, addressing problems created by systemically important institutions that are considered "too big to fail", and reforming the over-the-counter derivatives market.
There are, however, concerns that tighter regulation and the complexity of the framework might lead to a new wave of regulatory arbitrage.
Emerging-market and developing countries, in particular, may encounter serious difficulties in their capacity to implement the regulations, monitor their implementation and address potential unintended consequences for their financial system.
74. Both the quality and the coverage of multilateral surveillance to identify risks to financial and economic stability have been strengthened in recent years.

2.8 In response to question (f), the author submits that the main obstacles faced by the employment agencies are the social legislation in force and the division of responsibilities between different government bodies for the inclusion of persons with disabilities in the labour market.

2.8 In response to question (f), the author submits that the main obstacles faced by the employment agencies are the social legislation in force and the division of responsibilities between different government bodies for the inclusion of persons with disabilities in the labour market.
She submits that she asked a legal expert to explain the legal options for and limitations to the successful intervention of employment agencies to promote the inclusion of persons with disabilities in the labour market.
The expert stated:
In case of a disability that impairs working capacity not just temporarily, inclusion in the labour market cannot normally be supported by the integration allowance, as the benefit is typically not appropriate in such a case to achieve the legally defined objective.
This shortcoming in the legal implementation of the support concept has a profound effect on those concerned, since there is not normally any other benefit through which inclusion in the labour market could be supported in a similar way.

2.9 In response to the request for information on employment offers received, the author submits that, when applying for jobs, her son can only introduce himself to a store manager and submit his application.
Thereafter his fate lies in the hands of the employment agency.
Since according to the social legislation her son is not eligible for an integration subsidy, after making contact with the employment agency the potential employers withdrew their offers.

The author submits that disabled persons are not treated equally as compared to persons without disabilities when they apply for jobs and that the federal Government is concealing the fact that the social legislation is preventing their integration into the labour market.
2.10 In response to the request for the letter regarding the loss of part of her son's case file, the author submits copies of a letter from the employment agency to the Social Court, dated 12 May 2011, and of a letter from the Social Court, dated 17 May 2011.

3.1 On 15 May 2013, the State party requested the Committee to revise its admissibility decision.
3.2 In relation to the court proceedings regarding the granting of integration subsidies, the State party maintains that the imposition of the court costs for a wanton claim is not a punishment or a fine and that it only occurs "in case of a wanton pursuance of rights after the court has made an appropriate indication".
In the present case, those costs amounted to 375 euros and "did not constitute a considerable deterrent and an obstacle for the author's son to pursue his rights".
The request for a declaratory judgment before the Social Court of Cologne and at second instance before the Regional Social Court in Rhine-Westphalia was "wanton because the author had no legal interest in a finding, since only employers are legally entitled to claim integration subsidies".
The State party argues that the employment agency never denied the possibility of granting an integration subsidy should the legal conditions be met.

3.3 The State party further refers to the jurisprudence of the Committee against Torture, according to which it is not within the scope of the Committee's competence to evaluate the prospects of success of domestic remedies, but only whether there were remedies available for the determination of a claim.
It also highlights that the author's son was not prevented from applying to the Federal Court or the Federal Constitutional Court, which have jurisdiction in the matter.

3.4 The State party maintains that the author's son had failed to exhaust available domestic remedies with regard to several issues.
Firstly, the assumption of costs for the training he attended from 5 October to 27 November 2009 is a subject matter of proceedings before the Social Court of Cologne that are still pending.
Secondly, the failure to grant benefits in the form of a personal budget is a subject matter of proceedings before the Social Court of Cologne, lodged at first instance on 24 September 2012, and still pending.
Thirdly, the author's son has failed to raise the generalized allegations concerning the application of social legislation in the courts and therefore did not provide any possibility for the courts to review and, where appropriate, to remedy his complaint.

His "motion of challenge for fear of bias" of 11 September 2012 was rejected on 31 October 2012.
3.7 As to the lawsuit regarding the lawfulness of refusing to grant a "personal budget" to the author's son, the State party maintains that it is unlikely that it would succeed, because the author's son several times had failed to make the necessary applications for a personal budget.
3.8 The State party maintains that the author's son has failed to employ a number of other remedies, such as complaining to the Federal Government Commissioner for Matters relating to Disabled Persons; the Commissioner for Matters relating to Disabled Persons in North Rhine-Westphalia; the commissioners and coordinators for matters relating to disabled persons at the local level in Euskirchen or in Siegburg; or the Federal Anti-Discrimination Agency.
3.9 In response to question (b), the State party submits that the alleged discrimination against the author's son was not investigated by the courts because there was no reason to do so.
The subject matter of the lawsuit filed by the author's son was whether he had a "right to a tied discretionary decision to obtain a binding agreement on the part of the employment agency on the amount of the integration subsidy for a potential employer".

The Social Court of Cologne rightly notified the author's son that it was not him who was entitled to the right to an integration subsidy, but a potential employer.
The amount and duration of any such integration subsidy depend on the concrete circumstances of the employment relationship, so that an "advance decision" on the part of the employment agency is neither provided for by law, nor possible.
The request for a declaratory judgement that an employer willing to appoint the author's son would be entitled to a familiarization grant "is also not successful for lack of any interest in a finding".
The Regional Social Court rightly shared the legal view of the Social Court of Cologne.
The State party maintains that the alleged discrimination was "immaterial for the legal dispute" since, as an employee, the author's son had no right to the employer benefit "integration subsidy".

However, the author's son has neither applied to inspect the files, nor initiated court proceedings.
3.12 In response to question (c), the State party submits that, contrary to the statements made by the author in her comments of 5 February 2013, her son benefited from a "holistic placement measure" in the period from 1 April to 2 July 2009, planned to last for six months, allocated by the Brühl Employment Agency.
In accordance with section 37, book III of the Social Code, the employment agency is permitted to commission third parties to support or implement parts of tasks related to placement.
In this case the measure was carried out by Tertia GmbH.
The aim was to place unemployed persons in need of activation and support, and those with obstacles to placement, on the labour market.

Because of the discontinuation of the payment of unemployment benefits to the author's son, the placement voucher became invalid as of 6 August 2009.
At that time guidance could only be provided by the IFD if a valid placement voucher existed and the latter was contingent on drawing unemployment benefits.
The State party maintains that, in December 2011, the legislature made the law more flexible in favour of the persons concerned.
3.14 In a discussion held on 14 September 2009, an advisor recommended that the author's son apply to the agency responsible for basic security benefits for (employable) job-seekers, to request a placement voucher to receive guidance from the IFD.
The author's son made no such application.
In the same discussion, a four-week in-company training scheme was agreed.
3.15 In response to question (d), the State party submits that the range of benefits in employment promotion in accordance with book III of the Social Code is highly differentiated and multifaceted.

3.15 In response to question (d), the State party submits that the range of benefits in employment promotion in accordance with book III of the Social Code is highly differentiated and multifaceted.
However, as a matter of principle, unemployed persons with disabilities are not dealt with differently from unemployed people without a disability; they are not subject to a special separate system of employment promotion.
It is only when disability gives rise to a special need in comparison to people without a disability that there is provision for specific benefits.
In particular, benefits may be provided to persons with disabilities to promote their participation in working life as required by the nature or gravity of the disability, and to conserve, improve, create or restore their earning capacity (Social Code, book III, section 112, paragraph 1).
3.16 The State party submits that the benefits to promote employment are divided into general and special benefits.
General benefits are to be claimed as a matter of priority.

General benefits are to be claimed as a matter of priority.
The special benefits, which can also be provided on application as a part of a personal budget, are to be provided instead of the general benefits, in particular to promote basic and further vocational training.
The specialized training programmes available in this framework are individualized.
Needs are discussed and ascertained in an individual advisory meeting.
3.17 The State party clarifies that special benefits can also be implemented by a competent institution or jointly by several institutions through a personal budget.
The personal budget is not a separate benefit, but an alternative form of benefit provision.

It is intended to enable the beneficiaries to decide what benefits they wish to take up at a specific time, who is to provide the necessary benefit or assistance, and how this is structured.
Personal budgets usually are monetary payments paid on a monthly basis.
The rehabilitation institutions, the long-term care insurance funds and the IFD are involved in providing this budget, depending on the individually ascertained needs, as a "bundled benefit".
3.18 The State party submits that, on 11 May 2012, the author's son lodged an application for a personal budget.
The author's son did not respond to an invitation for an advisory meeting from the Brühl Employment Agency, on 13 June 2012.

5.1 The Committee notes the State party's submission that the issue of discrimination was not raised by the author's son before domestic courts.
4.19 The author lastly submits that the principle of equal treatment (in accordance with article 3, paragraph 1, of the German Constitution) does not entitle her son to integration support by the employment agency because such support is provided by the IFD.
She considers that in a federal State, the principle of equal treatment is only partially valid.

5.1 The Committee notes the State party's submission that the issue of discrimination was not raised by the author's son before domestic courts.
It observes, however, that the issue was raised by the author's son in his 9 February 2010 lawsuit before the Social Court of Cologne on the matter of issuing a binding decision on the amount and duration of the integration subsidy and in his appeal to the Regional Social Court, and reiterates its finding that it is not precluded from considering the communication under article 2 (d) of the Optional Protocol.

The Committee notes the State party's submission that the author and her son could have addressed a number of non-judicial institutions with complaints, but observes that the State party has failed to demonstrate how the said proceedings would have constituted an effective legal remedy for the alleged violations of the rights of the author's son.

The Committee, however, recalls that the issue before it is to decide whether the State party has complied with its obligation to facilitate the inclusion of a person with disabilities into the labour market in accordance with articles 3, 4, 5 and 27 of the Convention, and is therefore not the subject matter of the proceedings pending before the Social Court of Cologne.
5.3 As a consequence of the above, the Committee sees no need to revise its admissibility decision.

6.1 The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has considered the present communication in the light of all the information received, in accordance with article 5 of the Optional Protocol and rule 73, paragraph 1, of the Committee's rules of procedure.

6.2 The Committee takes note of the author's allegations that the provisions of the social legislation related to granting an integration subsidy are discriminatory, since they are applicable only to persons with disabilities whose full working capacity may be restored within 36 months; that they create no rights for the disabled person, since the right to claim such a subsidy belongs exclusively to the employer; and that the manner in which discretion is applied in implementing those provisions by the employment agencies leads to further discrimination.
The Committee also takes note of the State party's submission that the author's son is eligible for such an integration subsidy, should the legal conditions for allocating it be met.
The legal conditions appear to be that an employer should make a binding employment offer to the author's son and apply for the integration subsidy, after which the employment agency shall evaluate the situation and take a decision on the duration and amount of the integration subsidy to be allocated.
In any case, according to the State party's submission, the subsidy would amount to a maximum of 70 per cent of the wages, for a maximum period of 60 months (see para 3.29 above).
The Committee observes that the intention behind the above-mentioned integration subsidies scheme appears to be to encourage private employers to hire persons with disabilities.

The Committee observes that the intention behind the above-mentioned integration subsidies scheme appears to be to encourage private employers to hire persons with disabilities.
The Committee observes, however, that the said scheme in practice requires employers to go through an additional application process, the duration and the outcome of which are not certain, and that the disabled person has no possibility to take part in the process.

The policy seems to respond to the medical model of disability, because it tends to consider disability as something that is transitional and that, in consequence, can be "surpassed or cured" with time.

The policy is not consistent with the general principles set forth in article 3 of the Convention, read together with paragraphs (i) and (j) of the preamble.
The Committee also notes that general benefits, that are predetermined and presumably known to employers, exist to promote the employment of recent graduates without disabilities (see para. 3.16 above).

It also observes that article 3 establishes that in its legislation, policies and practice the State party should be guided by respect for inherent dignity, individual autonomy including the freedom to make one's own choices, and independence of persons; non-discrimination; full and effective participation and inclusion in society; and equality of opportunity.
In the instant case, the Committee is of the view that the existing model for the provision of integration subsidies does not effectively promote the employment of persons with disabilities.
In the instant case, the Committee is of the view that the existing model for the provision of integration subsidies does not effectively promote the employment of persons with disabilities.

The already mentioned administrative complexities put applicants in a disadvantageous position and may in turn result in indirect discrimination.
The Committee therefore considers that the integration subsidies scheme, as applied in the case of the author's son, is not in accordance with the State party's obligations under article 27, paragraph 1 (h), read together with article 3 (a), (b), (c) and (e), article 4, paragraph 1 (a) and article 5, paragraph 1, of the Convention.

In connection with the right to know the fate or whereabouts of disappeared persons, the Working Group welcomes the establishment by the executive branch of a Commission for the Search for Persons Disappeared during the Internal Armed Conflict and that a parallel preparatory commission is in place to work on the establishment of an equivalent body through an act of legislation.
In the meantime, the Working Group hopes that the establishment of the Search Commission of the executive branch will render the best results within its power to clarify the fate or whereabouts of disappeared persons that are before the Working Group, as well as any others.
The report also refers to the National Reparations Programme and the National Plan (2006-2016) for the Search for Persons Disappeared during the Internal Armed Conflict, proposed by the Search Committee, which are in line with the Declaration.
However, in the reports the Working Group endeavoured to explain that those principles should be applied in practice in a complete manner, and not be restricted to the delivery of money, as some sources reported occurs in the majority of cases.

In consultation with IAEA, UNSCOM established a special team, within the Baghdad Monitoring and Verification Centre (BMVC) organization, which was to include the planning and execution of capable site inspections by joint IAEA/UNSCOM multidisciplinary teams as a major component of its activities.
The carrying out of inspections at capable sites on a regular basis contributes to the effectiveness of the OMV plan in its ability to detect any attempt by Iraq to conduct activities prohibited by Security Council resolutions.
The current total of inspections at capable sites numbers some 45.
No indication of prohibited equipment, materials or activities has been detected in these inspections.
5. The tenth radiometric survey of Iraq's main watercourses was carried out from 20 to 30 October 1997.

6. The OMV activity of conducting routine interviews of key Iraqi personnel has continued but the efficiency of this activity is increasingly affected by difficulties in locating such personnel owing to their stated transfer from government jobs to the private sector.
Further work has been done to improve the implementation of aerosol sampling and fixed-point and land-vehicle-based radiometric surveys.
Work is currently in progress to evaluate the practicability of a plan for wide-area environmental monitoring as a means of strengthening OMV activities.
7. With the support of a Member State, an extensive baseline survey of environmental tritium concentrations was carried out over a period of 20 days in November and December 1997.
In addition, the survey team collected samples of tree sections to confirm the nature and chronology of past tritium activities.

IAEA has essentially depended on six Member States to provide personnel resources to support its activities in Iraq but, on this occasion, requests were made to some 20 additional Member States to provide suitably qualified technical experts for short-term assignment to work with the IAEA Nuclear Monitoring Group in Iraq.
About half of the Member States approached responded both promptly and positively such that IAEA is already able to satisfy its additional staffing requirements well into 1999.
It is hoped that other Member States will also provide such resources in the future.
9. As a result of Iraq's action of 29 October 1997, through which it sought to impose conditions on the inspection process, the Agency's ongoing monitoring and verification activities were suspended between 30 October and 22 November 1997.
Monitoring inspections were restarted on 22 November at the more significant sites and, for the period from 25 November to 4 December, IAEA assigned an additional 11 persons to the Nuclear Monitoring Group in order to expedite the completion of inspections required to re-establish baseline knowledge.

According to the Iraqi counterpart, the required penal laws are under active consideration.
25. Matters were discussed arising from the Agency's recent interview of one of the foreign nationals who had contributed to Iraq's centrifuge enrichment programme.
The principal outcome of that interview, facilitated by a Member State, was the foreign national's statement that he had made only two batches of carbon fibre composite cylinders (in total, 18 cylinders) for centrifuge rotors.
This statement differs considerably from that of the Iraqi counterpart, who attributed the supply of 50 cylinders to the individual concerned.
26. The Iraqi counterpart was firm in its insistence that the foreign national had, in fact, been the sole source of carbon fibre composite cylinders and that the number so supplied had been 50.

To this end, IAEA had held several discussions with the Iraqi counterpart to encourage it to examine its own activities - with particular respect to escorts - to assist IAEA in carrying out its OMV activities with minimum disturbance to the operation of the facilities under inspection.
Iraq's full, final and complete declaration
29. On 25 March 1998, Iraq provided to IAEA a computer disk containing its full, final and complete declaration, along with annexes and addenda, consolidating the text of the version dated 7 September 1996 and the revisions and additions resulting from subsequent technical discussions between IAEA and the Iraqi counterpart.
The consolidation of the full, final and complete declaration, which was an editorial task, brought together into one document information provided by the Iraqi counterpart and previously examined by IAEA, in particular during technical team visits in February, May and July 1997.

It was further agreed that an IAEA technical team would meet with the Iraqi counterpart, in Baghdad, to review and assess the document so produced.
The first version of the document was received in Vienna on 5 February 1998 and was found to require considerable revisions and additions which were brought to the attention of the Iraqi counterpart during a series of technical discussions held in Baghdad from 14 to 19 February.
Iraq responded to these discussions by producing a significantly improved document, which was received in Vienna on 13 March 1998.
This second document was subjected to a detailed technical review during a second series of discussions held in Baghdad from 26 March to 4 April.

Summary 31. IAEA continues its programme to update the technology used in its monitoring activities and to extend the range of those activities.
The first version of the document was received in Vienna on 5 February 1998 and was found to require considerable revisions and additions which were brought to the attention of the Iraqi counterpart during a series of technical discussions held in Baghdad from 14 to 19 February.
Iraq responded to these discussions by producing a significantly improved document, which was received in Vienna on 13 March 1998.
This second document was subjected to a detailed technical review during a second series of discussions held in Baghdad from 26 March to 4 April.
As a result of this review, the Iraqi counterpart produced a document containing a summary of the technical achievements of its clandestine nuclear programme which is regarded by IAEA to be consistent with the technically coherent picture of Iraq's clandestine nuclear programme, developed by IAEA in the course of its activities in Iraq.
Summary 31. IAEA continues its programme to update the technology used in its monitoring activities and to extend the range of those activities.
The surveys undertaken by the special group were completed efficiently and were, in most instances, facilitated by practical cooperation provided by the Iraqi counterpart.
The surveys conducted at the eight presidential sites revealed no immediate indications of the presence of prohibited materials or equipment or of the conduct of prohibited activities with respect to the mandate of IAEA under the relevant Security Council resolutions.
33. The Agency's ongoing monitoring and verification activities carried out since October 1997 have not revealed indications of the existence in Iraq of prohibited equipment or materials or of the conduct of prohibited activities.
34. Iraq has satisfactorily completed its undertaking to produce a consolidated version of its full, final and complete declaration of its clandestine nuclear programme.
35. The Iraqi counterpart has fulfilled its obligation to produce a document containing a summary of the technical achievements of its clandestine nuclear programme.

ARRANGEMENTS 2. As reported to the Governing Council at its thirty-ninth session in document DP/1992/23, the new support cost arrangements went into effect as of 1 January 1992.
Similar targets with respect to projects for other agencies had also been established.
These targets were conceived as a transitionary measure providing the agencies concerned with a stock of budgets to which the old arrangements would continue to apply while the new arrangements were phased in.
Additionally, and by collective agreement between UNDP and the agencies, UNDP field offices were provided the flexibility, as a matter of operational convenience, to continue to apply the old arrangements to those projects that already had reached an advanced stage in the formulation/appraisal process by 1 January 1992.
As a result of these measures, a level of $660 million of project budgets have been approved under the old arrangements, thus providing an increased level of transitionary protection to the agencies concerned.
Since 1 July 1992, all projects have been subject, on a mandatory basis, to the new arrangements.

It is planned to continue field testing of these guidelines for an additional period of time in 1993, at the conclusion of which it is expected that they will be incorporated in the Programme and Projects Manual (PPM) of UNDP.
4. In recognition of the importance, complexity and far-reaching nature of the new arrangements, UNDP and the agencies considered it essential that operational personnel in the field be fully trained in the use of the new facilities available under these arrangements.
Also, in paragraph 25 of decision 92/22, the Governing Council requested the Administrator to continue to expedite integrated training activities for concerned government, UNDP and agency personnel in the working of the new arrangements.
For this purpose, the Council also authorized the Administrator to use available funds within the overall provision of resources for support cost arrangements as set out in annex I of decision 91/32.
5. Accordingly, a series of training workshops designed with professional assistance and with the active collaboration of the agencies has now been carried out in the field.

5. Accordingly, a series of training workshops designed with professional assistance and with the active collaboration of the agencies has now been carried out in the field.
In this manner, it was hoped that by training a relatively limited number of practitioners, a far larger target audience would eventually be reached.
6. Twelve subregional workshops and nine national workshops were carried out in the field from October 1992 to February 1993.
These were attended by over 600 field personnel, consisting roughly of 270 UNDP staff, 150 government officials and over 180 agency personnel.
The workshops were conducted by teams of trainers drawn from both UNDP and the agencies, with most of the latter drawn from the core group that has worked on the development of the new arrangements in the last two years.
7. The self-evaluations conducted at the conclusion of each workshop have judged them effective.

The level of understanding of, and commitment to, the new arrangements on the part of field personnel appear to have increased significantly despite the varying levels of preparation of the participants and the perceived complexity of the new arrangements.
There has also been considerable appreciation of the tripartite nature of the workshops, which many participants recommended should become a model for such training programmes in the future.
It also appears to have helped generate a team spirit among the three partners, which is considered by many to be a very rewarding aspect of the training.
There has also emerged a clearer recognition of the opportunities and flexibilities provided under the new arrangements and particularly of the support services provided by the agencies.
Participants also made several recommendations for simplifications and improvements in the arrangements which, as stated in paragraph 3 above, will be reflected in revised guidelines in due course.

Estimates of contributions for 1993 currently amount to $930 million, which represents a decline of $143 million, or 13 per cent from 1992.
Based on this decline, as well as on current estimates of contributions for the remaining years of the fifth cycle, it appears that the target for annual increases in contributions of 8 per cent assumed in decision 90/34 of 23 June 1990 is unlikely to be achieved.
As a result, the indicative planning figures (IPFs) for the fifth cycle, which were established in line with these assumptions, may not be fully financed.
Additionally, the balance of liquid resources which had accumulated in the fourth cycle because of excesses of income over expenditures during the 1983-1988 period are expected to be drawn down to nearly zero at the end of 1995.
Taking all these factors into consideration, and following a detailed review, the Administrator has decided, in the interests of prudent financial planning, to establish a revised planning framework for the fifth cycle.

12. Table 1 presents a summary of the total programme budgets approved so far against the fifth cycle resources under various types of execution arrangements.
As discussed in paragraph 2 above, IPF projects approved under the old arrangements amounted to almost $1.5 billion of which $660 million related to the five agencies subject to the new regime of support costs.
Activities approved under the new regime during the period 1 July 1992 to 31 March 1993 amounted to $361 million, of which those relating to the five agencies amounted to $70 million.

It also assumes, as stated in paragraph 14 above, that 30 per cent of nationally executed projects will be assigned to agencies for implementation.
It may be noted from this table that 63 per cent of the resources projected to be available for the fifth cycle have already been approved, including 51 per cent under the old arrangements and 12 per cent under the new arrangements.
D. Provision for nationally implemented projects approved

16. As part of the transition arrangements (discussed in paragraph 2 of this report), the Governing Council had provided, in paragraph 16 of decision 91/32, that in respect of the first $140 million of nationally implemented projects approved for the fifth programming cycle resources, 10 per cent of the value of these projects shall be added to the relevant IPF sub-lines.

An amount of $17 million had been earmarked for this purpose, to be financed from unutilized resources carried over from the support cost line of the fourth programming cycle.

This process of identification of such projects, in chronological sequence of the date of their approval, has proven to be operationally difficult and the selection inherently arbitrary.
18. Additionally, an earlier decision of the Governing Council (decision 90/21 of 22 June 1990, para. 7) had specified that IPF add-on would continue to be paid for nationally executed projects approved before the end of the fourth programming cycle, leading several Governments and UNDP field offices to continue planning utilization of such add-on resources for an interim period in the fifth cycle.
The non-availability of the IPF add-on, in line with decision 91/32, has introduced an additional element of operational uncertainty and complexity to this process.
19. Taking these factors into consideration, the Administrator proposes that the intent of paragraph 16 of decision 91/32 would be better served if, instead of adding the specified resources to the IPF sub-line, the provisions of the IPF add-on legislation continue for one more year.
Thus, he intends to provide 13 per cent of 1992 project expenditures relating to nationally executed projects approved before 1 January 1992 as an add-on to the IPFs of the countries concerned.
This process of identification of such projects, in chronological sequence of the date of their approval, has proven to be operationally difficult and the selection inherently arbitrary.

As this table shows, under these assumptions approximately $260 million is expected to become available to the five agencies subject to the new regime, $54 million to OPS and $99 million for all other agencies combined.
It is also estimated that in the aggregate approximately $43 million will become available to developing countries as savings from the IPF sub-lines.
21. Table 3 provides a summary of the current status of the various financial provisions for support cost arrangements in the fifth cycle and, for comparison purposes, the original provisions approved in decision 91/32.
It will be noted that the current estimate of resources necessary to finance the new support cost arrangements amounts to $473 million, which represents a reduction of approximately 25 per cent from the originally established amount of $627 million.
22. Finally, concern has been expressed by the agencies over a slow-down in new project approvals in the fifth programming cycle, the consequent impact on the effective implementation of the new arrangements and the reduction in the flow of support cost resources to the agencies.

Indeed, it appears that field personnel are currently ready and fully capable of applying the new arrangements effectively following the completion of an extensive training programme in the working of the new arrangements and the development of and improvements in operational mechanisms for the implementation of new systems.
Unfortunately, however, these developments coincide with the decline of resources in the fifth programming cycle and the consequent likelihood that there would be a lower level of approval of new projects to which the new arrangements can be applied.
The Administrator shares the concern that the reduction in resources may constrain the full and effective implementation of the legislation on support costs and thereby compromise the achievement of the objectives established by the Council in paragraph 1 of decision 91/32.

A. Implementation of TSS-1 work programme for the 1992-1993 biennium
It is intended that more specific information on the substantive content and progress made with the implementation of the 1992-1993 work programme will be provided during the fortieth session of the Governing Council.
B. Preparation of TSS-1 work programme for the 1994-1995
27. The work plan for the 1994-1995 biennium is currently under preparation.
The guidelines originally proposed by the Governing Council in decision 91/32, and as modified by decision 92/22, require the provision of a work plan to the Governing Council for information at the session preceding the start of that biennium.
It was the underlying premise of the guidelines that the TSS-1 facility would be used to stimulate and leverage agency regular and other programmes and therefore the timing of the preparation of the former should be synchronized with that of the latter.

First, it is considered impractical to identify priorities for TSS-1 financing one to two years before the two-year period in which the activities will be implemented, particularly in view of the changing priorities in various developing countries.

It appears, therefore, that it will be more reasonable and useful in developing the TSS-1 programme to take into consideration the priorities and emphases of agency programmes rather than require the scheduling of one to be rigidly related to the other.
Third, experience suggests that an extensive consultation process involving the Government, agencies and UNDP should precede the approval of the programme in order to achieve effective implementation subsequently.
Indeed, the UNDP field offices and agencies have requested that a longer period be provided for the planning and formulation of the work programme for the 1994-1995 biennium, including consultations with the Government and agencies.
29. Taking these factors into consideration, the Administrator has established 30 June 1993 as the deadline for the submission of TSS-1 proposals for the next biennium.

It is also intended that the process of formulation will begin in the field and be governed by the priorities and needs identified at the country level. This is in contrast with the process adopted last year, when because of shortness of time, agency headquarters were requested to provide a list of proposals as a starting point for the exercise.
The review, appraisal and selection of proposals will be carried out in July 1993 and the approval completed by September 1993.
The Administrator proposes, therefore, that the finalized work programme be provided to the Council for information at its special session in February 1994.

30. The TSS-2 facility was established by the Governing Council, as stated in decision 91/32 (annex IV), for the purpose of increasing the quality of projects and to assist the Administrator in discharging his accountability by ensuring that technical support is available to all projects, irrespective of the arrangements for the delivery of administrative and operational support services.

Approval of TSS-2 budgets as of the end of March 1993 has amounted to $3.1 million.
As the TSS-2 facility is, in principle, available only for projects approved under the new arrangements in the sectors of competence of the five agencies, this level of approved TSS-2 budgets is considered consistent with the total project budgets approved so far under the new arrangements in these sectors (table 1).
Additionally, the field offices have been encouraged by both UNDP and the agencies to utilize the TSS-2 facility mainly for technical backstopping and only to a limited extent for project formulation as financing for the latter is usually available from other sources, including the Project Development Facility (PDF) and IPFs.
The almost exclusive use of TSS-2 for technical backstopping may, at this stage, have limited the overall utilization of the TSS-2 facility.
32. The Administrator has, however, been concerned, in light of the rapid increase in nationally executed projects in recent years, that all measures shall be undertaken to adequately backstop and support such projects with technical support services.

Accordingly, he has initiated a review in the field of all ongoing nationally executed projects, including those approved before 1 January 1992, in order to determine whether such technical support is required in these cases.
This review is currently under way.
Early indications are that, in some cases, TSS-2 budgets have been approved as a result of this exercise.
In many more cases, however, it was determined that technical support had already been provided in the project budgets and TSS-2 funding was not considered necessary.

In addition, an amount of $17 million may be available under the earmarking of $20 million for technical support for national execution.
VI. ISSUES RELATING TO SMALLER TECHNICAL AGENCIES
34. In paragraph 3 of decision 91/32, the Governing Council invited the specialized agencies not currently part of the new support cost arrangements to consider the possibility of participating in the new regime in light of the experience gained.
For this purpose, UNDP has maintained an ongoing discussion with these agencies on various aspects of the new arrangements.
35. In recent discussions, these agencies have expressed considerable concern at the significant decline in projects approved in the fifth cycle in the sectors represented by them and the consequent reduction in support cost reimbursements.

While these emphases are set in the broader context of the total development effort, and therefore are not inconsistent with nor discourage assistance in the technical areas, in practice it appears that country programmes based on these areas of focus tend to concentrate on the social sectors.

While these emphases are set in the broader context of the total development effort, and therefore are not inconsistent with nor discourage assistance in the technical areas, in practice it appears that country programmes based on these areas of focus tend to concentrate on the social sectors.
In the case of some of these agencies, there has been a reduction of 50 per cent or more in projects approved for execution in the fifth cycle as compared with the fourth cycle.

At the same time, the very limited financing available under UNDP sectoral support earmarking does not permit these agencies to carry out an extensive series of sectoral and programme development consultations.
38. Several of these agencies have stated that they recognize that the new support cost arrangements offer some attractive features, including resources for technical support and for participation in upstream, policy-related areas.
In particular, access to such facilities such as TSS-1 and TSS-2 would provide them an opportunity to participate in and provide technical support to Governments and UNDP in the implementation of nationally executed projects which have increased significantly in their sectors in recent years.
For this purpose, some agencies have indicated an interest in exploring with UNDP the possibility of a modified support cost regime for them which would include these attractive features of the new arrangements while preserving the simplicity of the current arrangements.
They emphasize that any such modified regime should take into account the limited scale but crucial technical character of their activities.

39. The Administrator shares the concerns of these agencies and will continue his consultations with them to develop proposals for consideration by the Governing Council at a future session.
The objective of such proposals will be to ensure that the technical capacities, contributions and support of these agencies will continue to be available to developing countries.
VII. MONITORING AND EVALUATION
40. In paragraph 23 of decision 92/22, the Governing Council took note of the proposal of the Administrator regarding the monitoring and evaluation of national execution and support cost arrangements and requested him to develop detailed performance indicators reflecting the objective of the new arrangements as set out in decision 90/26 of 22 June 1990.

It should be noted, however, that the new support cost arrangements are only a part of a larger package of legislative and policy measures adopted by the Governing Council to achieve these objectives including, inter alia, new initiatives relating to more effective use of national execution, the adoption of a programme approach and a renewed emphasis on human development and capacity-building.
Therefore, monitoring and evaluation of support cost arrangements, while limited to the implementation of these arrangements, should, however, take place in the context of the implementation of the entire package.
42. The performance indicators being developed can be classified under two broad categories and would include both quantitative measures which can be expressed in statistical data and qualitative measures which may not be so expressed.

Possible indicators and the information necessary to measure the achievement of these objectives are listed in the annex (category I).
44. The second category relates to technical support services and the objectives established by the Council of improving the technical focus of the agencies and minimizing the resources allocated for administrative and operational services (AOS).
Taking into account the multiple sources from which technical support requirements can be financed, the possible indicators and the information necessary to measure the achievement of these objectives are listed in the annex (category II).
45. After agreement is reached on the specific indicators which should be monitored on an ongoing basis, it will be necessary for UNDP and the agencies to collaborate in collecting and updating information on these indicators as programmes are developed and implemented during the fifth cycle.
At this time, the information systems of UNDP and the agencies are able to generate data on only some of the indicators.

:: Non-attendance at school and illiteracy of Batwa girls and women
:: Failure of the Burundian Government to punish gender-based violence.
Concerning the first point, we first explain the arrangements for Burundian women to exercise the right to participate in decision-making.
In general, women's participation in public institutions respects the principles of the Arusha agreement, providing for at least 30 per cent of women in the various decision-making institutions, in order to combat discrimination affecting the political and civil rights of women.
This has already been done, allowing women freely to express their views and to participate in the search for solutions to problems of this kind.

However, Batwa women in Burundi are still discriminated against and marginalized, because they are not included in the 30 per cent quota for decision-making institutions in Burundi or in the life of the country.
Yet articles 13 and 14 of the Constitution of Burundi encourage everyone without discrimination to participate in decision-making.

Yet articles 13 and 14 of the Constitution of Burundi encourage everyone without discrimination to participate in decision-making.
The right of all persons to participate in public affairs is also mentioned in article 13 of the African Charter of Human and Peoples' Rights and in the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women.
The fact that Batwa women are not represented in decision-making institutions perpetuates the violence against this vulnerable category of women and girls; no women participate in the sectors of national life responsible for adopting measures to punish the perpetrators of acts of violence, including sexual harassment, assault and ill-treatment by husbands and by other social groups.
In order to eliminate this discrimination against Batwa women:
:: The United Nations Indigenous Peoples' Partnership must be promoted in Burundi to guarantee the civil and political rights of Batwa women and girls
:: The Government of Burundi must ratify the 2003 Maputo Protocol to the African Charter concerning women's rights in Africa

:: The African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights and the Human Rights Council must be invited to monitor implementation in Burundi of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.
As far as education is concerned, very few girls in the indigenous population of Burundi even complete their secondary studies and indigenous girls in Burundi do not attend school because their parents cannot afford it.
No girls from the Batwa community have yet completed university studies.
About 15 girls have completed secondary school and the illiteracy rate is 80 per cent for the over 4 million Burundian women.

No girls from the Batwa community have yet completed university studies.
About 15 girls have completed secondary school and the illiteracy rate is 80 per cent for the over 4 million Burundian women.
Because of these problems, these girls never complete their studies.
They are also forced into early marriage, making them more vulnerable to HIV/AIDS.
In order for Batwa girls to receive an education, the Government of Burundi must:
:: Guarantee free education from primary school to university
:: Promote the United Nations Indigenous Peoples' Partnership in Burundi in order to guarantee the right to education
Because of these problems, these girls never complete their studies.
They are also forced into early marriage, making them more vulnerable to HIV/AIDS.

:: Make the parents of Batwa indigenous girls aware of the need to send their daughters to school
:: Enact legislation establishing penalties for men or boys who force minor girls to marry
:: Distribute food to parents so that Batwa girls can attend school.
As regards the last point, Batwa indigenous women in Burundi are subjected to violence connected with their horrible living conditions.

As regards the last point, Batwa indigenous women in Burundi are subjected to violence connected with their horrible living conditions.
In addition, Batwa women with HIV/AIDS are dying because they have no access to health care and support.
As far as access to equitable justice is concerned, Batwa women are not on the same footing as men.
According to Burundian custom, women cannot speak in the presence of men.
This tradition is an offshoot of the proverbs encouraging marginalization of women and discrimination against them.
For example, there is a proverb saying that the hen does not sing when the rooster is present.

2. The background of the project is provided in section I of the Secretary-General's report.
3. In March 2006, the High-level Committee on Management approved a jointly funded system-wide project to support a harmonized framework of IPSAS-compliant policies, provide guidance and support and achieve economies in addressing common implementation issues.
As indicated by the Secretary-General, the system-wide strategy for IPSAS implementation has two aspects: a phased approach to implementation and a two-level approach to resources.
The phased implementation strategy recognized that some United Nations system organizations were at a more advanced stage of readiness for IPSAS adoption than others and were targeting implementation effective 2008, while the majority of the organizations would benefit from lessons learned and were targeting IPSAS adoption effective 2010 or as soon as possible thereafter.
The two-level approach involves providing implementation resources at the system-wide level and at the individual organization level: harmonized IPSAS accounting policies and guidance are developed through a consultative process at the system-wide level, whereas each entity is responsible for establishing its own project team and dedicating sufficient resources to ensuring the implementation of IPSAS.
4. In paragraphs 9 to 11 of his report, the Secretary-General provides information on the governance, organization and budget of the system-wide IPSAS adoption project.

Ten organizations reported that they were continuing to target implementation in 2010, but others have deferred IPSAS adoption until 2011-2012.
As indicated in paragraph 24 of the report, during 2008 concerns were raised about certain entities and their readiness for IPSAS adoption in 2010, as it became clear that they had not completed some of the requisite steps.
The implementation steps that must be completed before December 2009 in order for 2012 implementation to proceed without major risks are set out in paragraph 28 of the report of the Secretary-General. A list of the United Nations organizations and their IPSAS implementation targets is provided in annex III to the report.
The Advisory Committee stresses the key role of the system-wide Steering Committee and project team in sharing information, supporting the participating organizations through all phases of their projects, providing guidance on implementation requirements and project planning and monitoring implementation progress.

The Secretary-General views awareness training as a key component of the overall change-management process.
Conceptual training is to be delivered through both computer-based and instructor-led training courses.
Computer-based conceptual training will be widely available to all staff, while instructor-led training primarily targets specialized staff in finance and related areas.
In paragraphs 70 to 72 of his report, the Secretary-General provides further details on the training plan, including the time frame, the trainers and the number and location of workshops.
The Advisory Committee notes that the transition to IPSAS represents a major effort in terms of training and change management.

The primary goal of energy pricing reform should be to create a well-functioning competitive market, aimed at increasing economic efficiency and improving the quality of energy services.
Unbundling vertically integrated monopolies.
Liberalizing the energy sector by introducing wholesale and retail competition.
Promoting best practices in managing public and private energy companies.
Improving the environmental performance of the energy sector.
The general public should be informed about the benefits of energy-sector reform and market-based pricing, notably the resulting gains in economic efficiency and GDP growth, the more efficient use of energy consumption and lower emissions of CO2 and pollutants.

The prices of energy products and services, with the exception of petroleum products, are usually set by some kind of a State body in countries in transition.
Two major principles need to be taken into account in regulating energy prices:
Customers should receive adequate service at reasonable rates.
Utilities should be provided with a reasonable opportunity to recover all their costs, including the costs of capital (a fair return on investment).
For the efficiency of the energy sector and the entire economy the most important factor is that prices reflect long-run marginal costs (LRMC).

2.3 Encouraging Efficient Consumption
The correct energy prices provide market signals that motivate consumers to use energy efficiently.
In non-energy-intensive sectors, where energy costs do not exceed 2-5% of total operating costs, it is nonetheless important for companies to exploit opportunities to use energy more efficiently when the rate of return on investments in energy-efficient technologies is acceptable.
Generally, such investments require a payback of no more than five years.
Rational energy use is even more important in energy-intensive sectors, iron and steel, glass, non-metallic minerals and heavy chemicals, where energy costs can account for as much as 40% of total operating costs.

Subsidies for family houses and multi-dwelling houses to finance investments in energy efficiency, such as cheap loans and tax concessions.
2.4 Attracting Investments into Energy Sector
The use of energy by energy industry itself in countries in transition represents on average 30% and 40% of total primary energy supply.

The use of energy by energy industry itself in countries in transition represents on average 30% and 40% of total primary energy supply.
Once the right conditions are achieved, energy companies could make good the lack of investment in the past.
Energy price reform and liberalization of the energy industry would help improve the efficiency of energy production and supply.
3. Price Signals to Consumers
The population should be informed of plans to reform energy prices in a timely and effective manner.
It is a major exercise to communicate to the population and to make it understand why the Page 4 reform is necessary and beneficial for society and the economy as a whole.

The population should also be persuaded that prices reflect only those costs that are related to the supply of the energy service in question and that the relevant costs are as low as possible.
It should be explained that price reform is a key element of moves to promote sustainable development, protect the environment and raise people's standard of living.
The population needs to understand that the price of all products, including energy, should reflect production and distribution costs as well as a reasonable profit to cover the cost of capital.

Producer-side subsidies are also common.
Where import prices are volatile, prices changes are often passed on to consumers by the regulatory body in an arbitrary manner.
This lack of transparency, which hinders efforts to improve the efficiency of energy pricing and remove subsidies, is a pressing issue in many countries in transition.
In vertically integrated network industries, unbundling of the accounts and management of the different parts of the supply chain would reveal cross-subsidies and make it easier to remove them.
At the same time the regulatory body responsible for pricing should take care that the logic behind pricing and the frequency and timing of price changes are widely known and understood.

Whatever the chosen approach, prices should normally reflect the LRMC of energy production, transport and distribution, including a fair return on investment.
In determining the LRMC, the exact cost of all elements of energy supply needs to be calculated for the various consumer categories taking account of differences in load characteristics.
The introduction of cost-based tariffs should be seen as a transitional move.
In the long run, the goal should be to move to market-based pricing through the introduction of competition in the wholesale and retail supply.
In this way, the free market would determine the price of the energy commodity, with the price being free to rise and fall in response to scarcities and surpluses.

Utilities' costs, including operation and maintenance, administration, depreciation, tax and interest charges, can be grouped according to the various functions of energy supply; namely, production, storage (in case of gas), transmission, distribution and overheads.
Page 6
In practice, these costs have to be allocated to different customer categories, to different types of service (for example, firm and interruptible) and to different types of charges, as described in section 5 above.
Energy costs reflect the volume of consumed energy.
Capacity costs can be calculated for each customer category through detailed analysis of system loads, taking into account how certain customers influence such costs.

They generally pay a fixed charge and an energy charge according to metered consumption.
Flat rates are also quite frequently used where the energy charge is independent of actual consumption, usually where the service is un-metered.
The amount of capacity charge is a controversial issue in the case of such customers.

Administration costs.
Other issues also need to be considered, such as the extent to which revenues are collected in cash, how much consumption is not billed and un-metered consumption.
Raising tariffs towards LRMC requires these issues to be resolved.
8. Frequency of Price Adjustments
Regulated energy prices should be adjusted in a timely and predictable manner.

Identifying those customers is not always easy because of incomplete household statistics on poverty and energy consumption.
Human passivity, health conditions, cultural reasons and pride which can discourage poor people from applying for subsidies, can also prevent support from being directed to targeted households.
The group of eligible consumers can be determined based on earlier applications for aid, voluntary application and affordability criteria.
If this share exceeds a given level, the so-called fuel-poverty level (for example, 15%), the household would be eligible to receive support.
In some countries, eligibility is linked to the energy Page 8 consumption of the household.

II. EXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE GUIDELINES ON REFORMING ENERGY SUBSIDIES
1. Definitions and Scope
Broader definitions attempt to capture other types of government interventions that affect prices or costs, either directly or indirectly.
For the purposes of these guidelines, an energy subsidy is defined as any government action that concerns primarily the energy sector and that lowers the cost of energy production, raises the price received by energy producers or lowers the price paid by energy consumers. The baseline is assumed to be market prices and costs.
This means that any government action that seeks to address a market failure by reducing the price or cost of energy to internalize an external environmental or social benefit (i.e. a positive externality) constitutes a subsidy.
The above definition encompasses a wide range of government interventions in the energy sector, but excludes non-energy government policies and measures that might nonetheless unintentionally lead to lower energy prices in an indirect way.
Government actions that primarily concern the transport sector, for example, can significantly affect the cost and price of providing an energy service.

Trade instruments, including quotas, technical restrictions and embargoes.
Energy-related services provided directly by government at less than full cost.
This includes direct spending on energy infrastructure and public agencies performing service functions, and the waiving of bills, which effectively makes the energy service free to the consumer.
Regulatory controls, such as price controls, demand guarantees, mandated deployment rates for certain types of energy technology, market-access restrictions, environmental regulations, technical standards, licensing and certification.
Publicly funded energy research and development.

A producer subsidy - a government intervention that has the effect of lowering the cost of production - would normally lead to a lower price to the final consumer, because it stimulates producers to raise output.
A consumer subsidy is a government action that directly reduces the price of a fuel or energy service to consumers.

Consideration of subsidies and their reform must take account of taxes, since they offset the effect of subsidies on price.
In many cases, energy subsidies are more than offset by special taxes and duties (other than the standard rate of sales or value-added tax that applies to all goods and services) that raise the final end-use price to above free-market levels.
Differential rates of taxation can give a competitive advantage or disadvantage to one fuel or energy form over another in the same way as a subsidy.
2. Objectives and Approach
A subsidy by its very nature involves a complex set of changes in economic resource allocation through its effect on costs and/or prices. These shifts inevitably have economic, social and environmental implications.

By lowering the price paid for a fuel or the cost of using it, a subsidy will stimulate use of that fuel, leading to increased air pollution and emissions of greenhouse gases.
Inefficient use of energy and outright waste caused by underpricing or even zero-pricing (in the case of unmetred supplies or non-collection of bills) is a common problem in some economies in transition.
Higher fossil-fuel production can also damage the environment directly, by polluting water supplies and spoiling the landscape.
Public funding of fossil-fuel research and development, a form of energy subsidy, may ultimately lead to Page 11 higher consumption, but may also yield positive environmental effects if it results in the use of more efficient, cleaner-burning technologies in the long term.
They can place a heavy burden on government finances, worsen the balance of payments and weaken the potential for economies to grow.

Subsidies to fossil fuels undermine the competitiveness of renewables and investments in energy efficiency.
To the extent that they reduce returns on investment and cash flows, they can undermine private and public investment in the energy sector. As a result, they can impede the expansion of energy services as well as the development of more environmentally benign energy technologies.
Subsidies often benefit mainly energy companies, equipment suppliers and better-off households, who consume more of the subsidized fuel and have better access to it. Meanwhile, the entire population, including the poor, shares the cost.
Subsidies also encourage cheating and corruption.
The primary goal of subsidy reform, therefore, should be to minimize the harmful effects while maximizing the benefits. This will involve changing the subsidy mechanism and/or reducing the overall size of subsidies.

Eliminating subsidies completely is justified when they are clearly harmful to the environment or impede economic development and trade while bringing minimal social or local economic benefits in the long term.
Subsidies on any economic activity can in principle be rationalized on the basis of theoretical arguments concerning market failures or imperfections that lead to economically sub-optimal outcomes.

A subsidy can be justified if the net gain in social welfare or the environmental improvement that it brings about exceeds the net economic cost.
Energy-market failures include external costs, such as pollution, and barriers to market entry that impede the efficient operation of competitive markets.
Government intervention, which may involve the use of subsidy, can help to remedy such market failures, either by addressing their causes or by trying to replicate the outcome of a perfect market.

For example, support for renewable energy sources or for the deployment of energy-efficient technologies can bring real social, environmental and economic benefits, depending on circumstances and how that support is provided.
But practical considerations can make achieving those goals difficult. In practice, policy-makers have to strike an appropriate balance between reliance on the market and intervention to address social and environmental policy goals.

reorganizing State enterprises.
Institutional reform involves reorganizing public structures and bodies in order to improve governance of the energy sector.
Sustaining financial discipline in the public budget and State enterprises, including enforcement of payments, is a vital component of economic and institutional reform.
Non-payment of electricity, gas and district heat bills, an implicit form of subsidy, remains a major problem in some economies in transition.
Policy makers, however, should seek to incorporate the external costs of energy production, supply and use in the prices of energy services where possible, using market-based instruments such as taxes or regulations such as limits on airborne emissions.

Policy makers, however, should seek to incorporate the external costs of energy production, supply and use in the prices of energy services where possible, using market-based instruments such as taxes or regulations such as limits on airborne emissions.
Getting market signals right so that prices better reflect the true costs of producing and consuming energy, taking account of the environmental and social consequences, should always be a key guiding principle.

Subsidies for maintaining service to poor households may also be justified on practical and humanitarian grounds.
This may be the case where the climate is extremely cold, where energy represents a very large share of household spending and where welfare-support schemes fail to provide adequate protection for all poor people.
3. General Principles of Subsidy Reform
In most instances, governments are faced with awkward trade-offs, both between the economic, social and environmental effects of reforming subsidies and between those consumers or producers who stand to lose out and those that stand to gain.
But, in many cases, removing or reforming energy in combination with other policy measures, such as those aimed at rationalizing the tax system, could bring important net overall economic and environmental benefits.

Governments should place priority on removing or at least reducing the size of those subsidies that are clearly harmful to the environment as well as being economically costly.
Subsidy removal, in this case, would be a win-win policy reform.
Many subsidies that encourage fossil-fuel consumption fall into this category. Page 13

There may nonetheless be a good case for retaining subsidies in specific instances, especially where they are aimed at encouraging more sustainable energy use.
Examples might include temporary support for new renewable and energy-efficient technologies to overcome market barriers, and measures to improve poor or rural households' access to modern, commercial forms of energy.
But the way in which a subsidy is applied is critical to how effective it is in meeting policy objectives and its cost.

There is no single right approach or model to designing or reforming subsidy policies.
Every country needs to take account of national and local circumstances. These include the country's own policy objectives and priorities, its stage of economic development, market and economic conditions, the state of public finances and the institutional framework.
But there are a number of basic principles that countries need to apply in designing subsidies and implementing reforms to existing programmes.
Experience shows that subsidy programmes and their reform should meet the following key criteria:

Experience shows that subsidy programmes and their reform should meet the following key criteria:
Efficient. Subsidies should not undermine incentives for suppliers or consumers to provide or use a service efficiently.
Soundly based. Subsidies should be justified by a thorough analysis of the associated costs and benefits. Practical.
The amount of subsidy should be affordable and it must be possible to administer the subsidy in a low-cost way. Transparent.
The public should be able to see how much a subsidy programme costs and who benefits from it.
Limited in time. Subsidy programmes should have limited duration, preferably set at the outset, so that consumers and producers do not get "hooked" on the subsidies and the cost of the programme does not spiral out of control.

Each of these principles and how they should be applied in practice are considered below.
3.1 Targeting
Targeting subsidies effectively so their benefits are limited to a clearly defined targeted group should be the first consideration in reforming or designing a subsidy programme. The targeted group would normally be a certain type of producer or category of consumer; for example, the operator of a wind turbine or poor households.
Page 14 or all consumers, regardless of their income or the form of energy cause major economic distortions and costs, and should, therefore, be avoided.

Generally, it is easier to target consumer subsidies than producer subsidies, since the former is applied at the point of sale.
Targeting is, therefore, primarily an issue for consumer subsidies, which should be restricted to the poorest households and to the environmentally cleanest energy sources.
The definition of poor households should not be so wide that it captures more than a small proportion of the population.

In general, energy consumption is strongly correlated to income level.
There are various ways of applying such rates, which affect how well targeted the subsidy is:
A subsidy can be applied to the standing charge covering the fixed monthly cost of maintaining a connection to the network - a capacity subsidy.
If this rate were applied only to households subscribing to the lowest capacity, for example 3 kW for electricity service, this subsidy would be largely limited to the poor.
Richer households, which consume more energy, would normally subscribe to higher capacity, for which subsidized rates would not be available.

Richer households, which consume more energy, would normally subscribe to higher capacity, for which subsidized rates would not be available.
There is, nonetheless, a danger of abuse, since richer households may try to obtain more than one subscription for the same address, especially if the potential savings are large.
A subsidy can be applied to the tariff for each kWh of energy consumed - a commodity subsidy.
If the subsidized tariff were applied only to the first, small tranche of consumption, households consuming small amounts of energy would profit most.
Alternatively, a subsidized tariff can be applied to households subscribing to the lowest capacity.

Moreover, they are less likely to encourage waste.
Both types of subsidies require good metering to be effective.
Producer subsidies should generally be limited to renewable energy sources that bring environmental benefits and that are already close to being competitive with conventional fuels and technologies.
However, public support for research and development -- a form of subsidy -- may be justified for non-renewable energy sources if it can be shown that such support will promote more efficient and, therefore, less polluting energy use.

Research into other energy technologies aimed at enhancing a country's domestic production capacity and energy-supply security might also make sense. But research and development efforts should always be focused on those fuels and technologies that are most compatible with public policy goals and that are considered to have the best chance of becoming commercially viable within a reasonable period of time.
3.2 Efficiency
Energy-subsidy programmes should always be designed in a way that does not undermine incentives for consumers to use energy efficiently or for producers and suppliers to provide a service efficiently.
In the case of consumer subsidies, both the size and the subsidy mechanism affect how efficiently energy is used.
The larger the subsidy on electricity, for example, the less incentive consumers will have to conserve electricity and to use it efficiently.

The larger the subsidy on electricity, for example, the less incentive consumers will have to conserve electricity and to use it efficiently.
They will be less inclined to buy efficient appliances and to take advantage of time-of-day tariff differences that reflect the higher cost to the utility of providing supply at times of peak demand.
The way in which an energy service is subsidized will also affect its marginal cost to the consumer and, therefore, the incentive to use the service efficiently.
In general, commodity subsidies are more likely to discourage the efficient use of energy than capacity subsidies.
Consumer subsidies in the form of government controls that keep prices below the full cost of supply or allow consumers to avoid paying their energy bills should not be allowed to penalize financially the energy-service provider.

They will also discourage new investors from entering the industry.

Fixed, subsidized commodity tariffs for renewables-based power give a stronger incentive to invest in the most efficient technologies, since the amount of subsidy a producer receives depends on output.
In practice, some combination of capacity and commodity subsidies may be the best approach.
3.3 Rationale
Because subsidies can result in serious market distortions and adverse environmental, social and economic effects, it is essential that any decision to introduce or retain a subsidy should be soundly based.
Too often, a subsidy is introduced to support a specific social or environmental goal, without serious analysis of all the consequences.

Too often, a subsidy is introduced to support a specific social or environmental goal, without serious analysis of all the consequences.
It is incumbent on the authorities to present a convincing case for the subsidy based on a thorough and coherent analysis of all the associated economic, social and environmental costs and benefits.
The burden of proof should be on demonstrating the net benefits of both new and existing subsidies. Since market conditions and policy objectives change over time, this type of exercise must be carried out on a regular basis to ensure that the case for maintaining a subsidy remains valid.
Carrying out this type of analysis requires reliable data, including market assessments and customer surveys, and effective analytical capacity.
Where that capacity is lacking, governments must develop training and education programmes and make use of external expertise, either from international organizations or consultants.

3.4 Practicality
The cost of administering the subsidy scheme, including the cost of preventing and dealing with cheating and abuse.
Subsidy programmes involving cash payments to producers or consumers are notoriously expensive to administer, since the authorities need to verify that each recipient is entitled to the money.
Cheating can be commonplace and difficult to prevent. Page 17
The overall cost of a subsidy scheme should never be allowed to become a serious burden on the national finances.
One way of avoiding this is to place financial limits on on-budget subsidy schemes.

Once a technology or a distribution network is established and economic, the subsidy would normally no longer be needed.
4. Implementation of Reform
Reforming energy subsidies must take account of practical barriers to reform. The biggest barrier is usually resistance from those groups that benefit from the subsidy and politicians who champion their cause.
By its very nature, the costs of an energy subsidy are usually spread throughout the economy, while its benefits are usually enjoyed by only a small segment of the population -- not necessarily the targeted group.
Those beneficiaries will always have an interest in Page 18 defending that subsidy when their gains exceed their share of the economic or environmental costs.

Benefits that involve primarily indirect gains in economic efficiency are abstract and difficult to demonstrate to the public.
Where the environmental benefits are global, such as reduced greenhouse-gas emissions, the public may not care much, especially where poverty is widespread.
For these reasons, it can be very hard for policy makers to remove subsidies once they have been introduced.
Resistance to reform tends to be particularly strong in the economies in transition. In these countries, the general public often still considers energy to be a basic social good, like food and housing, the pricing of which should not be left solely to market forces.
Resistance to reform makes it especially important for policy makers to be extremely cautious in devising new subsidies.

As a rule, a new subsidy should be introduced only if the immediate net benefits are demonstratively large and likely to persist for a long time.
Reforming existing energy subsidies requires strong political will to take tough decisions that benefit society as a whole.
In general, politicians tend to be more willing to tackle difficult subsidy issues immediately after elections in the hope that opposition to reform will have diminished by the time new elections come around.
The following approaches can help policy makers to overcome resistance:

That goal may be considered socially desirable.
It may also be the price that has to be paid to achieve public and political support for removing or reducing the subsidy.

In most UNECE countries, the public is becoming familiar with the environmental advantages of renewables and natural gas over coal, making it harder for politicians to maintain support to ailing coal industries.
The problem of non-payment of energy bills must be dealt with vigorously, but with due regard to the welfare of poor households.

Mr. RODRÍGUEZ CUADROS, referring to Mr. Pinheiro's working document containing proposals relating to the work of the World Conference (A/CONF.189/PC.1/13/Add.1), drew attention to one of the points which Mr. Pinheiro had considered to be a matter of priority for the Conference, namely, the phenomenon of xenophobia with regard to the situation of migrant workers.

Such movements threatened the peaceful coexistence of individuals, social groups and States in that they encouraged violence, aggression and war and sometimes even jeopardized international peace and security.
Racial discrimination in such a context took on new forms.

It was alarming to observe that those forms were becoming increasingly frequent in many European countries and that migrant workers and their families, along with refugees, were the main victims.

Studies showed that it was only in the long term that the liberalization of trade would have positive effects in developing countries; meanwhile, those countries were affected by growing unemployment and under-employment.
That was why workers from those countries emigrated.
The developed countries, confronted with that phenomenon, were to an increasing extent closing their frontiers.
It was a contradiction of the globalization process, which was becoming a source of conflict.
According to a recent ILO study, 120 million people were concerned, and the problem was spreading among developing countries.

Tensions became acute when migrants settled in host countries where they found themselves faced with legislation that frequently discriminated against them and violated their rights.

As Mr. Eide had said, discrimination against them in criminal matters was particularly serious.
In contrast to those deplorable developments, there were also forward-looking initiatives.
The European Union's decision to impose sanctions on a country which had brought to power individuals whose ideology was incompatible with democratic principles and respect for human rights was a step in the right direction.
Legislation in favour of migrant workers was also encouraging, such as the Aliens Act recently adopted in Spain, which contributed to the integration of foreign workers into Spanish society.
Legislation of that nature ought to have a constructive influence on other countries.

It was not a matter of calling in question the right of States to regulate the entry to and residence on their territory, but of whether such regulations fully respected the fundamental rights of foreigners, or if on the contrary they encouraged, even unintentionally, discrimination and xenophobia.
The World Conference against Racism should therefore not only adopt an international programme to promote the human rights of non-nationals and migrant workers in general, but also define a set of principles and rules concerning the rights of those workers and their families, which all countries would incorporate into their domestic law.
It was also essential that affirmative action should be taken to prevent violations of migrants' rights at all stages of the criminal justice system.
More generally, the Conference should encourage the drafting of a set of principles to ensure that temporary guarantees to migrant workers were respected pending the ratification and entry into force of the Convention for their protection.

Mr. PARK pointed out that racism and racial discrimination were closely related to issues of peace and security, as certain events since the end of the cold war had amply demonstrated.
The forthcoming World Conference should therefore be an integral part of action in favour of a harmonious and peaceful existence for all.
From that point of view the SubCommission should spare no effort to ensure its success.
The recent development of xenophobia in Europe was a matter of great concern.
Incitement to hatred and hostility to foreigners via the Internet were reaching unacceptable levels.

There was a need to curb the phenomenon, not only because foreigners were equally human beings but also because they contributed to the economic and social development of the countries in which they settled.
The Millennium Summit to be organized by the United Nations in September 2000 should be the occasion for drawing up a response to the challenges of the twenty-first century.
He proposed that the Sub-Commission should examine the best means of using the Summit to mobilize international public opinion and stress the importance of the World Conference in the struggle against racial discrimination.
The joint declaration which would be adopted following the Summit should contain a reference to the Conference.
Similarly, the parliaments of States Members of the United Nations, the media, civil society, etc., should be encouraged to reaffirm their commitment to the struggle against racism, to define more efficient means of combating racial discrimination, and to envisage the possibility of compensating victims of acts of discrimination, bearing in mind the cultural context of each nation.

Stress should be laid on the role of regional human rights institutions and agencies since they had been established above all for putting an end to racial discrimination.
He complimented Mr. Pinheiro, Mr. Weissbrodt, Mr. Oloka-Onyango and Mr. Bossuyt on the quality of their studies, which were an excellent contribution to the World Conference.
Mr. RAJEEH PRASAD (Observer for India), speaking in exercise of the right of reply, said he was not persuaded that the question of castes, to which reference had been made during the debate on agenda item 3, was related to racism, racial discrimination and intolerance.
Although the caste system was based on birth, it was obvious that the term "descent" as used in article 1 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination referred to racial descent.

It was true that the members of "scheduled" castes were traditionally subjected to discrimination and exclusion; however, the Indian Government unequivocally condemned such practices.
The Constitution of India mandated affirmative action in favour of members of disadvantaged castes.
Some of them held very senior positions in the political executive.
Seats were reserved for them in the Parliament and State Legislative Assemblies and in government services and educational institutions.
Special legislation had also been enacted for the protection of their civil and political rights.

Where affirmative action was concerned, the policy adopted by Malaysia had a temporal target and clearly identified the beneficiaries.
Affirmative action policies had also been framed as laws by the Parliament.
Malaysia believed that such measures should result in a more equitable share of the rewards of growth.
Its stability and economic growth testified to their success.
Mr. GUISSÉ , replying to a number of delegations who were of the opinion that the issue of castes was not relevant to the questions which the Sub-Commission was required to consider under agenda item 3, said that the caste system was a genuine expression of practices of social exclusion and discrimination.

The CHAIRPERSON recalled that the Commission on Human Rights, in decision 2000/102, had approved the appointment of Mr. Oloka-Onyango and Ms. Deepika Udagama as Special Rapporteurs on the question of "Globalization and its impact on the full enjoyment of all human rights".
Mr. OLOKA-ONYANGO said that the question of globalization had developed spectacularly since the previous year.
It was indeed extremely broad and multi-faceted.

It was indeed extremely broad and multi-faceted.
It was also extremely controversial.
The Rapporteurs had based their study on three broad considerations: first, the characteristics and the definition of globalization; secondly, the role of the most prominent institutional actors, namely, the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the multilateral financial institutions - the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF); thirdly, the issue of equality and non-discrimination, with particular attention to sexual inequality and the phenomenon of racial discrimination.
Lastly, the authors had examined the applicable human rights instruments and the role and place of the United Nations institutions in globalization.
The definition of globalization used took into account the tremendous developments in information and communications technology and its implications for human rights.

Of particular concern to the Special Rapporteurs was the fact that the institution's fundamental raison d'être appeared to be the consolidation of freemarket theories.
The Organization acted as if there was a level playing field in the market when as a matter of fact the mechanisms were skewed against economies in the South in general and against individuals of colour, minorities, women and indigenous peoples in particular.
One of the most controversial aspects of WTO's mandate was patenting, and particularly the Agreement on Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS).
All those aspects were compounded by WTO's lack of transparency.
Where the Bretton Woods Institutions were concerned, policies of finance, investment and economic reform advocated by the World Bank and IMF were of particular concern.

It might be asked to what extent those institutions considered themselves bound by the international human rights instruments and to what extent they took basic human rights principles into account.

Ms. DEEPIKA UDAGAMA pointed out that globalization had so profound an impact on humanity that any discourse on human rights had to be situated in that context.
Because of globalization, disparities were becoming ever greater between and within nations, since only certain sectors of society benefited.
According to a report of the United Nations SecretaryGeneral of July 1999, absolute poverty in the world was growing.
More than 1.5 billion people lived on less than one dollar a day.
The disparities had further marginalized already vulnerable groups in society, particularly women who were increasingly numerous in the labour market; in 1996, the overall economic activity rate of women for the age group 20-54 was approaching 70 per cent.

As the report noted, countries continued to relax labour standards to attract foreign direct investment in a perverse "race to the bottom".
The United Nations Secretary-General had stressed that adverse labour conditions were a major factor contributing to the growing feminization of poverty.
In addition, the reduction of social security measures provided by the State in the new economic environment had exacerbated the economic insecurity of women workers.
Economic globalization was a complex phenomenon and indeed did not only have negative aspects.

A balance needed to be struck between liberalization and social justice, on the understanding that globalization must be subjected to the rules of international law.
That required that the fundamental principles laid down in the Charter of the United Nations must be strictly adhered to by those spearheading globalization.

The Rapporteurs were looking forward to the deliberations of the Sub-Commission's working group on transnational corporations.
She considered that all United Nations organs and agencies should take on the challenges posed by globalization.
Specialized agencies such as UNCTAD and ILO and the human rights bodies such as the Economic and Social Council, the Sub-Commission and the Commission on Human Rights performed valuable work in that regard.
However, where treaty-based mechanisms were concerned, except for the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, most did not appear to emphasize sufficiently the impact of economic globalization on their respective mandates.
The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights must give leadership in that regard.

Mr. GUISSÉ was delighted at the evocation of problems with which he was familiar as a national of a third world country.
The phenomenon of the privatization of resources which could enable the inhabitants of third world countries to live decently had now become international.
Supported by IMF and the World Bank, WTO was taking a regrettable approach which quite simply consisted in privatizing the international community.
The Sub-Commission, established to ensure the protection and promotion of human rights, should be consistent and prevent that private colonization, the sole aim of which was profit.
Globalization would lead to the aggravation of poverty among the poor and widen the gulf between rich and poor, or even cause the disappearance of some populations.

The United Nations could take the logical step of opposing the existence of an organization like WTO which had declared that United Nations rules did not apply to it.
The international financial institutions which supported a policy of that nature had never served other than to assist the powerful to the detriment of the poorest.
Their very existence had contributed to aggravating poverty.
If an organization like WTO held the world's reins, the countries of the third world that wished to participate in exploiting the Earth's resources and sharing in the profits would no longer be able to make themselves heard.
Mr. YOKOTA said that although it was true that all human rights were indivisible and should be treated comprehensively, too much emphasis had been given in the past to "civil and political rights".

For the full realization of those rights, national programmes of action should be drawn up specifying concrete targets to be achieved with a timetable for each, geared to each country's circumstances.
In order to ensure economic, social and cultural rights for all, new resources were needed, particularly for the least advanced developing countries.
It would be useful to strengthen international cooperation through the international aid agencies and ensure that the latter concentrated more on human rights as part of their activities.
He fully endorsed the position of the authors of the report on globalization and its impact on the full enjoyment of all human rights concerning the role of the international economic and financial institutions such as WTO, IMF and the World Bank in the globalization process of economic activities, and particularly their lack of sensitivity to the economic, social and cultural rights of those who lived in poverty.
No attention had hitherto been given to the detrimental consequences of their policies and activities on the peoples of developing countries who were faced with price rises, unemployment and cuts in social welfare as a result of the draconian conditions imposed on them.

The Forum would submit information and suggestions to the Economic and Social Council.
Mr. FAN began by reading the third part of the declaration adopted by the Millennium Forum of NGOs on 26 May 2000.
The passage, entitled "Facing the challenge of globalization: equity, justice and diversity", revealed that if for some globalization was transforming the world into a global village with consequent political and economic changes that opened unprecedented possibilities of prosperity, to most, globalization was a process of economic, political and cultural domination by the economically and militarily strong over the weak.
For example, in the 1960s the combined assets of the top 200 corporations had accounted for 16 per cent of the world's Gross Domestic Product (GDP), 24 per cent by the early 1980s and 34 per cent in 1995.
In that process not only had the gap between the haves and the have-nots widened but the ranks of the poor were swelling, civil societies were being threatened and Governments were becoming dependent.

Above all, it was the right of a nation, the right of a society.
The idea of presenting the human person as the central subject of development was misleading since it was a question of promoting a new international economic order based on sovereign equality, interdependence, mutual interest and cooperation.
Two basic conditions were required to guarantee respect for economic, social and cultural rights in a country - a good general level, particularly in economic and scientific achievements, and social justice and fair income distribution.
Poor countries certainly encountered more difficulties than rich ones, but social inequalities and injustice also existed in rich countries.
Lack of efficiency, poor governance and corruption were likewise not the monopoly of developing countries.

It was desirable for developing countries to benefit from high-technology banking and economic management while maintaining their traditional values and specific national conditions.

With reference to UNDP's "Human Development 2000" report, he welcomed the assertion it contained that human development was essential for realizing human rights and that human rights were essential for full human development.
The following chapters, however, gave the impression that the authors wished to emphasize human rights, particularly political freedoms, rather than economic development.
He was of the view that development was the infrastructure of a society while human rights were part of the superstructure.
Political rights were indispensable for ensuring the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights but could not genuinely be enjoyed without development and without prosperity.
Mr. YIMER, referring to the demonstrations in Seattle and Washington, which would no doubt be repeated in Prague, said that those reactions revealed the importance of the stakes of globalization at the international level.

As paragraph 7 of the report of the Special Rapporteurs stated, understanding the political and other dimensions of the phenomenon of globalization was essential to the development of a rational and considered response to it.
He considered the issues raised in paragraph 24 of particular importance in that they dealt with the responsibility of the international financial institutions with regard to human rights.

Chapter 3 for its part, on globalization, equality and non-discrimination, was of capital importance in his view.
As the report said, it was an absurdity to assert that globalization had created the inequalities; they had existed well before the emergence of globalization as a phenomenon on its own account on the international scene.
Globalization had merely reinforced them.
He quoted a passage from an editorial that had appeared that day in the International Herald Tribune on the Secretary-General's initiative known as the "Global Compact".
According to the article, the backlash against globalization would gather force until measures were applied to soften its harsher side.

Bearing in mind the conclusions of the Special Rapporteurs' report concerning the adverse effects of globalization on the full enjoyment of all human rights, she suggested that the Sub-Commission and the Special Rapporteurs should keep a close watch on specific violations resulting from the implementation of programmes designed by the multilateral financial institutions and encourage the latter to take human rights into account in their decisions.
The Special Rapporteurs could, for example, include in their next report a description of some of the decisions taken by the institutions in the course of the year, and an analysis of their effects on human rights.
The Sub-Commission should also continue to consider the direct and indirect effects of the activities of private companies on human rights.
The Global Compact, in which the Secretary-General defined nine basic principles with which the transnational corporations must comply and regarding matters involving the environment and working standards, was a very forward-looking innovation.
The work of the Working Group on labour methods and the activities of transnational corporations was also useful in that regard.

The Sub-Commission had an important role to play in ensuring that States required both national and foreign companies to comply with international human rights standards.
Lastly, one aspect of globalization, namely, the development of information and communications technologies, had been very positive for non-governmental organizations, which had been able to circulate very rapidly throughout the world information concerning the activities of the multilateral institutions, transnational corporations and States.
She encouraged those organizations to continue to keep public opinion informed of the abuses and violations linked to globalization.
Ms. MBONU regretted that the report under consideration had become available only the previous day.

The legitimacy of globalization was being called in question because sufficient attention had not been given to its political, economic, social and cultural implications in developing countries.
Although the majority of developing countries had made poverty alleviation their priority objective, policies of austerity were imposed on Governments by the multilateral institutions leaving them practically no resources for job creation.
Unemployment affected 60 million young people in the world according to ILO and its consequences were the development of national and trans-border criminality, prostitution, drug trafficking and trafficking in human beings.

The realization of economic and social rights in developing countries was not possible if some of them were obliged to sacrifice a quarter of their export earnings to service the debt.
She supported the recommendation of the Special Rapporteurs that existing debt relief measures must be reviewed from the human rights perspective (para. 63).
Recalling Sub-Commission resolution 199/10 and Commission on Human Rights decision 2000/107 on the Social Forum, and realizing that it would not be possible to hold it during the session of the Sub-Commission which had been reduced by a week, she said she intended to submit a draft decision calling for the Social Forum to meet in the form of a presessional working group.
Lastly, she welcomed the work of the Working Group on the working methods and activities of transnational corporations, especially its decision to develop a code of conduct for companies based on international human rights standards.
Unemployment affected 60 million young people in the world according to ILO and its consequences were the development of national and trans-border criminality, prostitution, drug trafficking and trafficking in human beings.
The realization of economic and social rights in developing countries was not possible if some of them were obliged to sacrifice a quarter of their export earnings to service the debt.

Mr. KARTASHKIN, noting that the authors of the report admitted that they had not been able to examine all issues in depth, said that he hoped that the gaps would be filled and that subjects which had not been addressed in the preliminary report would appear in the final report.
Globalization was not a temporary phenomenon but a long-term process destined to expand still further.
As Ms. Frey had said, the relations between the State and the actors in the market were changing, but States continued to play a decisive role in international relations by the very fact that they defined international standards and would have the new task of monitoring their implementation by the agents of globalization.

It should be stressed that those organizations should not merely criticize the activities of the bodies involved in globalization, but should also propose constructive solutions.
Globalization had positive as well as negative effects; the latter included the growth of inequalities.
It was the duty of the Sub-Commission to propose solutions which would eliminate the negative effects.
The recommendation contained in paragraph 66 of the report, to formulate guidelines which would elaborate the obligations of the main actors of globalization, was very pertinent.
He would emphatically encourage the Special Rapporteurs to draw up guidelines of that type.

According to WHO, 80 per cent of illnesses were transmitted by polluted water.
Water quality thus had a decisive influence on the exercise of the right to health.
As for the right to housing, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights had stated in its General Observation No. 4 that it involved permanent access to drinking water and sanitation.
In developing countries, the shortage of drinking water supply systems was a considerable obstacle to the education of girls, who had to go long distances to fetch water and therefore could not attend school.
The right to a healthy environment was threatened by the constant deterioration of the quality of water as a result of pollution and a massive use of pesticides and other chemicals.

Before giving the go-ahead to the study on the right of access of everyone to drinking water supply and sanitation services, the Commission on Human Rights had requested the SubCommission to define that right.
He considered that for the time being no such definition was either possible or useful.
Even developed countries which had incorporated the right in their legislation had never given an accurate definition of it.
He hoped to be able to submit a preliminary report on the question of access to drinking water in 2001, an interim report in 2002 and his final report in 2003.
Mr. BENGOA agreed with Mr. Guissé that the right of everyone to drinking water supply and sanitation services was a fundamental right.

For Ms. Lizin, "Extreme poverty suggests not merely material deprivation but also social exclusion".
In his opinion, poverty itself equally involved exclusion.
The concept of "extreme poverty" seemed to him to be slightly paternalistic and to carry with it notions of pity and charity.
He was surprised that in her report (para. 15) Ms. Lizin had quoted a former World Bank President, Mr. McNamara, who had stressed that "the poor countries had the fundamental right to a minimum of food, health care and education."
The quotation was all the more surprising in that, as Mr. Oloka-Onyango and Ms. Udagama had emphasized in their report, the international financial and trade institutions carried a large share of responsibility for the poverty which burdened many countries.

It would be desirable that the International Declaration on human rights and poverty - if it was to be drafted - should emphasize the need to emancipate the poorest groups.
Stress should be placed on providing autonomy not assistance when it came to the enjoyment of all human rights for the victims of poverty.

Mr. RODRIGUEZ CUADROS pointed out that globalization had a positive effect when it contributed to affirming the universal nature of the international system of human rights and democratic principles.
Where the adverse effects were concerned, the Special Rapporteurs should add further details to their study.
Since the letters of intent signed by countries within IMF were official documents, their content should be analysed so that the cutbacks in expenditure which the structural adjustment programmes were liable to produce could be examined.
Those cutbacks had extremely damaging repercussions in such areas as health and education and social welfare generally.
In order to mitigate the adverse effects of globalization it was not enough to resort to emergency measures on behalf of the most vulnerable groups whose very survival was at stake.

In their study on globalization, Mr. Oloka Onyango and Ms. Udagama should stress the obligation incumbent on States which implemented structural adjustment programmes to ensure the economic, social and cultural rights of their population and in order to do so regulate their companies' activities without, however, challenging the freedom of their economic exchanges.

Where the right of access to drinking water was concerned, Mr. Guissé had clearly shown the links between access to drinking water and the fundamental rights - the right to life, to adequate food, to health, to development and to a healthy environment.

Mr. SIK YUEN shared Mr. Guissé's opinion that the right of access to drinking water should be considered a human right.
Where the preliminary report on globalization and its impact on the full enjoyment of all human rights was concerned, Mr. Guissé had rightly stressed that the key idea in globalization was profit and that a handful of economic actors had supreme control of the markets.
A vast trend towards concentration was in progress.
Two hundred companies alone accounted for 34 per cent of the world's gross domestic product.

It encourages the State party to sensitize the judiciary, lawyers and prosecutors to the provisions of the Convention and to the Optional Protocol.
12. While noting the efforts undertaken to identify and amend discriminatory legal provisions, the Committee is concerned about the lack of priority afforded to comprehensive legal reform to eliminate sex-discriminatory provisions and close legislative gaps to bring the country's legal framework fully into compliance with the provisions of the Convention.
The Committee is concerned, in particular, about the delay in passage of the family protection bill and the revision of the Citizenship Act.

15. The Committee requests the State party to take note that the terms "equity" and "equality" are not synonymous or interchangeable, and that the Convention is directed towards eliminating discrimination against women and ensuring de jure and de facto (formal and substantive) equality between women and men.
The Committee therefore recommends that the State party expand the dialogue among public entities, civil society and academia in order to clarify the understanding of equality in accordance with the Convention.

It also requests the State party to strengthen its impact assessments of measures taken so as to ensure that such measures achieve their goals and targets.
20. While noting with satisfaction the provision for temporary special measures in article 5 (1) (k) of the Constitution, the Committee is concerned about the State party's lack of clarity of the purpose of such measures and their limited use.
21. The Committee recommends that the State party draw up a concrete plan for the application of temporary special measures in various areas, particularly in education and women's participation in political and public decision-making, in accordance with article 4, paragraph 1, of the Convention, and with the Committee's general recommendation 25.

36. Ms. Gallardo Hernández (El Salvador), Vice-Chairman, recalled that, during the preliminary meetings, IPU had requested to participate in the country-specific meetings in cases where its role in the relevant process was a fundamental one, as in the case of the meetings on Burundi and Sierra Leone.
37. The Chairman said that he had consulted with IPU, which would continue to play a role in certain countries, including Burundi, particularly in the area of capacity-building.

40. The Chairman noted that a timeline for meetings of the Organizational Committee was being circulated in the room.
He suggested that the Organizational Committee should hold two substantive informal briefings on Burundi and Sierra Leone, to be attended by representatives of the two Governments, senior officials of the United Nations, the World Bank and IMF and outside experts, on 19 July, with the third and fourth formal meetings of the Organizational Committee to be held on 7 and 8 September and 21 September.
The meetings of 7 and 8 September would be country-specific meetings on Burundi and Sierra Leone, while the meeting of the 21st would be a follow-up meeting at the ministerial level.
41. Mr. Malcolm (United States of America) said that the scheduling would create difficulties for his delegation, since the officials from his Mission who should attend were in Geneva at a meeting of the Economic and Social Council.

He asked whether the briefing could instead be scheduled for the first week of August.
42. Mr. Ozawa (Japan), referring to the meeting proposed for 21 September, said that the presence of numerous ministers in New York at that time was not, in and of itself, reason to hold a ministerial meeting.
43. Mr. Abdelaziz (Egypt) asked the purpose of the meeting scheduled for 21 September.

He noted that, if a meeting was to be held at the ministerial level, it was important that all ministers should participate.
44. The Chairman pointed out that 21 September was International Peace Day.
However, the most important reason for the meeting was to give political approval to the hoped-for results of the meetings scheduled for 7 and 8 September.

50. Mr. Christensen (Denmark) said that in his understanding the purpose of the 19 July briefing was to provide members with information on Sierra Leone and Burundi.
However, if that meeting was going to involve the presentation of information followed by questions and answers, the material concerned would be useful for the country-specific meetings.
51. Mrs. Mladineo (Croatia), referring to the proposal put forward by the United States to reschedule the 19 July meeting to the beginning of August, said it would be difficult for small missions to send representatives to the meeting then.
Thus, 19 July was preferable to early August.
52. Mr. Smirnov (Russian Federation) requested clarification regarding the outside experts mentioned on the tentative list of participants in the country-specific meetings.

He would also like to know what the format of the briefings would be.
53. The Chairman said that the term "outside expert" referred to experts from institutions or organizations outside the United Nations system.
54. Mr. Wolfe (Jamaica) noted that the tentative list of members for the country-specific meetings on Sierra Leone, unlike the list for Burundi, made no mention of countries of the region engaged in post-conflict activities.
Thus, 19 July was preferable to early August.

54. Mr. Wolfe (Jamaica) noted that the tentative list of members for the country-specific meetings on Sierra Leone, unlike the list for Burundi, made no mention of countries of the region engaged in post-conflict activities.
He wondered what were the key West African countries involved in post-conflict activities for Sierra Leone and, if so, why they were not listed.
55. Mr. Ntakirutimana (Burundi) suggested a meeting format which would give each country the opportunity to brief the Organizational Committee in detail.
Member countries of the Commission should be invited and should have the opportunity to meet with representatives of Burundi and Sierra Leone to request further details.
At a later meeting, strategies could be developed which could have value, for example, during the General Assembly.

56. Mr. Abdelaziz (Egypt) said that the meeting of 19 July should provide sufficient time for Burundi and Sierra Leone to describe their strategy and explain what they needed from the Commission.
That information should then be discussed in informal meetings with other participants in the country-specific meetings.
That meeting should be followed by meetings on 21 and 22 July to follow up the 19 July discussion.
He noted that briefings should not be limited to Government and United Nations officials.
In reference to the question posed by the representative of Jamaica, the countries in the region involved in post-conflict activities were Nigeria and Ghana.

The meeting should begin with briefings by country representatives from Burundi and Sierra Leone.
It would be particularly helpful if the speakers were from the capitals, as they would have a clear vision of national post-conflict strategy.
Following those briefings, a representative of the Secretariat should provide information on the status of the relevant issues in the Security Council, including discussion of the financial resources required from the international community and identification of the roles played by actors invited to the country.
Finally, the Chairman should conclude with a discussion of future action.

59. Mr. Johnston (United Kingdom) said he strongly endorsed the statement made by the representative of Pakistan as the model for how the Commission should proceed.
In order for the work to be successful, candid, informal dialogue was required.
The proposed date of 19 July was perhaps too soon, given the preparations that would be necessary.
He endorsed the point made earlier that a ministerial meeting in September might not be well-advised.
60. Mr. Majoor (Netherlands) said that country-specific meetings were the most appropriate place for the Commission to address the substance of country situations.

64. Ms. Mladineo (Croatia), endorsing the comments made by the representatives of Pakistan and the Netherlands, said that background information was needed in advance of a substantive meeting on 19 July, inter alia in the form of input from the capitals concerned.
Without such information, delegations would find it difficult to work, and it might be necessary to consider ruling out a ministerial meeting in September, since there would be insufficient time for substantive and constructive work ahead of that meeting.
65. The Chairman, welcoming the suggestions made, said that discussions had already been held with the countries concerned as to what would be expected of them at the July meeting, and also with representatives of the World Bank and senior United Nations officials, who had also been advised of the proposed schedule of meetings.
The meeting on 19 July would essentially consist of briefings and possibly questions and answers, which would facilitate preparations for the substantive meetings on 7 and 8 September.
He also welcomed suggestions to continue to hold informal meetings at the expert level throughout July and August, given the need for clarification of a number of issues in advance of the September meetings.

While he understood the concern that the timing of the proposed meeting in July was not ideal, given that it would coincide with the substantive session of the Economic and Social Council in Geneva, those members of delegations who would be remaining in New York could attend the July meeting and brief their colleagues in preparation for the meetings scheduled for September.

The proposed date for the fourth formal meeting of the Committee on 21 September would remain under consideration, and might be rescheduled to a later time.
66. Mr. Abdelaziz (Egypt) said that while his delegation agreed with the Chairman on the question of the timeline, written documents should be provided in advance of the meeting scheduled for 19 July in order to allow delegations to prepare.
He also welcomed suggestions to continue to hold informal meetings at the expert level throughout July and August, given the need for clarification of a number of issues in advance of the September meetings.
While he understood the concern that the timing of the proposed meeting in July was not ideal, given that it would coincide with the substantive session of the Economic and Social Council in Geneva, those members of delegations who would be remaining in New York could attend the July meeting and brief their colleagues in preparation for the meetings scheduled for September.
He understood that much more preparation was needed in order to render the meetings scheduled for September and other meetings more substantive.
The proposed date for the fourth formal meeting of the Committee on 21 September would remain under consideration, and might be rescheduled to a later time.

66. Mr. Abdelaziz (Egypt) said that while his delegation agreed with the Chairman on the question of the timeline, written documents should be provided in advance of the meeting scheduled for 19 July in order to allow delegations to prepare.
To that end, the countries concerned should submit their strategies to the Chairman for translation into the six official languages and subsequent distribution among member States; delegations could then study those documents and discuss them with their respective capitals and, ideally, on a bilateral basis with the countries concerned.

No progress would be made if the meeting was convened only for oral presentations and discussions.
67. The Chairman said that the proposed briefings should not be postponed beyond July, since it was important that the Committee should press ahead with its work as soon as possible.
68. Mr. Malkin (United States of America) suggested that the Committee should postpone the July meeting by a week, thus accommodating the valid concern expressed by previous speakers regarding the need for written information and allowing more time for participants to prepare.
However, not wishing to disrupt the proposed timeline, his delegation was willing to agree to hold the meeting on 19 July.
69. The Chairman said that while postponement by one week was possible, it would put pressure on the Secretariat to provide the necessary documentation.

69. The Chairman said that while postponement by one week was possible, it would put pressure on the Secretariat to provide the necessary documentation.
It was preferable that the July meeting should take place as scheduled.
The Secretariat had consulted with the authorities of Sierra Leone and Burundi in order to ensure that the proposed dates were convenient, and would consult them also regarding the participation of representatives from the capitals.
70. Mr. Ozawa (Japan) said that while his delegation understood the concerns that written documents were required in advance of the meeting, it was undesirable to postpone the scheduled briefings on 19 July, particularly since a great deal of effort had been undertaken to organize them.

Although no formal date had yet been scheduled for the launch of the Fund, the forthcoming meetings in September would be a suitable occasion.
A number of contributions had already been made to the Fund, which was already approaching half the target sum of 250 million dollars, and several pledges had been announced.
75. Regarding the Peacebuilding Support Office, he informed the Committee that the position of Head of Office had already been filled.
Ms. McAskie of Canada would be assuming her functions formally at the end of August or beginning of September.
Three posts in the Professional category and three in the General Service category were also available, and were expected to be filled by September or October.

Three posts in the Professional category and three in the General Service category were also available, and were expected to be filled by September or October.
In addition, the Secretary-General intended to seek three secondments from agencies within the United Nations system, to which end the agencies concerned had been approached to nominate three candidates with a view to their appointment in August.
Five posts to be made available through redeployment were expected to be allocated to the Peacebuilding Support Office shortly.
The Office as it stood consisted of a small transition team supplemented by a small number of part-time staff.

The Committee would continue work with the Secretariat in order to enable the Office to enter into full operation as soon as possible.
Letter from the President of the European Commission
77. The Chairman drew attention to a letter dated 8 June 2006 from the President of the European Commission addressed to the Secretary-General requesting that the European Commission be considered an institutional donor within the terms of paragraph 9 of General Assembly resolution 60/180 and paragraph 9 of Security Council resolution 1645 (2005) and therefore be invited in that capacity to all meetings of the Peacebuilding Commission.

79. He proposed that the question should be addressed on a case-by-case basis, particularly when country-specific meetings were considered, and stressed the importance of reaching a consensus within the Organizational Committee.
80. Mr. Christensen (Denmark), speaking on behalf of those members of the Organizational Committee that were European Union members, said that the institutional donors played an important role in supporting and enhancing the work of the Peacebuilding Commission, and that the Commission would benefit greatly from their maximal involvement both in country-specific meetings and meetings of the Organizational Committee.

He therefore urged the Commission to agree to a model whereby institutional donors were invited on a permanent basis to all meetings.
81. Mr. Awad (Egypt) said that it was his delegation's understanding that paragraph 9 of General Assembly resolution 60/180 referred to meetings of the Commission in all its configurations.

81. Mr. Awad (Egypt) said that it was his delegation's understanding that paragraph 9 of General Assembly resolution 60/180 referred to meetings of the Commission in all its configurations.
However, while his delegation endorsed the comments made by the representative of Denmark, it was uncomfortable with the proposal for a standing invitation.
The institutional donors should not be invited automatically, but on a case-by-case basis according to whether such participation was deemed appropriate and necessary by the Committee.
Notwithstanding that comment, their permanent participation would be beneficial, and could be provided for in the future.
82. Mr. Tarragô (Brazil) said that the request by the President of the European Commission should be examined in more detail vis-à-vis in the light of paragraph 9 of General Assembly resolution 60/180.
The treatment of the European Commission on a par with institutions such as the IMF and the World Bank would give the impression that the institutions referred to in paragraph 9 were the same as or similar to the IMF and the World Bank.

The treatment of the European Commission on a par with institutions such as the IMF and the World Bank would give the impression that the institutions referred to in paragraph 9 were the same as or similar to the IMF and the World Bank.
The European Commission was of a unique nature in that it was not only an institutional donor but also had many other functions, and therefore differed significantly from those agencies.
In that light, his delegation requested that the Committee defer consideration of the issue in order to allow delegations more time to examine it.
83. The Chairman endorsed the comments made by the representative of Brazil.
84. Mr. Johnston (United Kingdom), responding to the comments made by the representative of Egypt, said that it was his understanding of paragraph 9 of General Assembly resolution 60/180 that the World Bank, the IMF and any other institution determined by the Organizational Committee as constituting an institutional donor would be invited to participate in all meetings of the Commission, and that that invitation was therefore a standing invitation, in accordance also with paragraph 9 of Security Council resolution 1645 (2005) and paragraph 102 of the World Summit Outcome contained in document A/RES/60/1.

It was therefore difficult to understand why that provision should be the subject of contention, leading to the proposal for a case-by-case approach.
His delegation strongly endorsed the view that the European Commission should be considered an institutional donor, particularly since it was a multinational organization and a major donor in many countries that were relevant to the work of the Peacebuilding Commission.

85. He disagreed that the invitation to institutional donors, whether generic or case by case, should apply only to country-specific meetings.
Since the Peacebuilding Commission consisted of various configurations, it was logical to interpret an invitation to all meetings as implying all meetings of the Organizational Committee in addition to country-specific meetings.

87. Mr. Wolfe (Jamaica) said that his delegation strongly endorsed the comments made by the representative of Egypt.
As a beneficiary country, Jamaica would be happy to welcome the European Commission as an institutional donor, whether invited on a case-by-case basis or otherwise.
However, a distinction should be made between meetings of the Organizational Committee and those of the Commission.
He would therefore welcome further consideration of the matter before a decision was taken.

(i) Harmony with Nature (continued) (A/65/314)
1. Mr. Zan (Myanmar) said that while the international community had made great strides towards promoting sustainable development, persistent implementation gaps remained in poverty eradication, food security, income inequalities, climate change and water sanitation, and the approach taken towards achieving sustainable development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), was fragmented.
Against that backdrop, and in the light of the multiple crises facing the international community, the opportunity of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, to be held in Rio in 2012, must be seized.
2. The eradication of poverty figured prominently on Myanmar's development agenda as that scourge was both the cause and effect of environmental degradation.
To address environmental protection, his Government had strengthened national legislation, had established a national commission on environmental affairs in 1990, and had adopted an environmental policy to ensure that environmental concerns were incorporated into national economic development programmes, among other measures.

3. Countries needed to work together towards substantive outcomes at the upcoming Conference on Sustainable Development, and developing countries must be given more equitable access to the benefits of the world economy, through a supportive international economic environment, the transfer of environmentally sound technology and adequate additional financial resources.
4. Mr. Kohona (Sri Lanka) called for the early establishment of a fund to address the impacts of climate change.
His Government also endorsed the establishment of a global partnership to synergize investment in climate change mitigation, as the private sector could be a major catalyst in addressing global warming through corporate social responsibility.
5. Negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change needed to reach a satisfactory conclusion, based on the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities.
The Ad Hoc Working Group on Further Commitments for Annex I Parties under the Kyoto Protocol and the Ad Hoc Working Group on Long-term Cooperative Action under the Convention should continue their work with a view to obtaining a legally binding outcome in Cancún at the sixteenth session of the Conference of the Parties to the Framework Convention in December 2010.

9. The principles contained in the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, adopted in 1992, remained valid; the Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development and the Marrakesh Process were also integral parts of the progress achieved.
Moving forward, the concept of a green economy should complement the globally agreed sustainable development principles.
Nevertheless, developing countries still required technological transfers, knowledge-sharing and capacity-building.
Moreover, major consumers and waste producers must take steps to ensure the environmental sustainability of their production and consumption patterns.
10. Ms. Bruell-Melchior (Monaco) welcomed the adoption of the Nagoya protocol on access to genetic resources and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from their utilization at the recent meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity in Japan.

The agreements reached at the recent meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biodiversity should also be effectively implemented, particularly the Nagoya protocol.
18. Recalling that Colombia was home to more than 10 per cent of the world's biodiversity, he said that its achievements to date reflected its commitment to protecting its heritage.
The economy was relatively clean, since Colombia had the lowest emission levels per unit of gross domestic product in Latin America and almost 90 per cent of its energy was derived from water.
Striving to recover, maintain and preserve its flora and fauna, Colombia had made significant investments both nationally and internationally in order to achieve the relevant MDGs.
19. Biodiversity and development were interlinked and had great potential for eradicating poverty, particularly in countries of origin.

He also reaffirmed the provisions of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development and the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation, particularly with regard to the removal of obstacles to sustainable development.
One such obstacle was foreign occupation, first and foremost the Israeli occupation of Arab territory in Palestine, the Golan and South Lebanon, an issue that must also be reviewed by the forthcoming Conference.
21. Climate change was likely to have adverse impacts on development in the Arab region, such as a decline in agricultural production and plant cover, a loss of biodiversity, inadequate food security and a threat to many vital economic investments.

There would also be many social consequences stemming from the migration of population from affected areas, both within and between States, with growing pressure on the environment and resources.
22. Dealing with the possible consequences of climate change would require international mobilization and solidarity to achieve sustainable development goals that would benefit all States, with special importance accorded to helping those developing countries most likely to be affected by climate change.

24. All countries must exercise full sovereignty over their genetic resources and traditional knowledge and practices.
25. Speaking in his national capacity, he said that economic development based on the use of conventional energy was not sustainable since it destroyed the natural resources needed to promote present and future economic activity.
The benefits of growth must be shared equitably in order to address the global priority of poverty eradication, which remained inseparable from socio-economic development and environmental protection.
26. The objectives of sustainable development, as enshrined in Agenda 21 in 1992 and repeatedly endorsed by Member States, required the mobilization of additional funding for developing countries.
While remarkable progress had been made, many of those objectives had not been attained: several outstanding issues, including climate change, environmental degradation and the impact of the financial crisis, called for an intervention by the international community as a whole.

In the face of that challenge, Morocco welcomed recent international developments, including the conclusion of the Nagoya protocol and the adoption of the Strategic Plan for the Convention on Biological Diversity for the period 2011-2020, and hoped that the positive outcomes of the Nagoya meeting would in turn help to ensure the success of the forthcoming Cancún Climate Change Conference.
Recent United Nations initiatives, such as the proposed high-level meetings on disaster reduction and desertification and the establishment of a high-level panel on sustainable development, also deserved every support.
28. Morocco, for its part, had resolutely embarked on a course of sustainable development, out of a concern not only to manage its resources rationally but also to improve the quality of life of its people.

In the energy field, Morocco was seeking to diversify its resources through a 2000 megawatt solar mega-project, which would be operational in late 2019.
In the matter of risk prevention, which was seen as the shared responsibility of citizens and the State, the Moroccan natural disaster strategy reflected the spirit of the Hyogo Declaration adopted at the 2005 World Conference on Disaster Reduction.
29. Morocco had also drawn up a Natural Charter for Environment and Sustainable Development, which established an ethical framework for sustainable development based on the preservation of biodiversity.
The choice of Rabat to lead the celebrations for the fortieth anniversary of Earth Day in 2010 attested to the achievements of Morocco, which was rightly regarded as a development model for Africa.
30. At the international level, a great deal hinged on the question of governance.

33. Ecuador was taking constructive action to reach a consensus to that effect.
In that spirit, it had voluntarily decided not to exploit the oil reserves that it possessed in one of the most biodiverse regions in the world, thereby forfeiting revenue that could serve for its development.
As a result of that decision, which would yield benefits for the planet as a whole, Ecuador needed the support of the international community.
34. As a megadiverse country, Ecuador welcomed the outcomes of the tenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity, particularly the establishment of an international system of access to genetic resources and benefit-sharing.
While Ecuador had joined the Countdown 2010 network and was committed to fighting biodiversity loss, without the support of the international community, especially the developed countries, developing countries like his own would not be able to achieve sustainable development.

There was therefore an urgent need for all countries to enter into a firm political commitment and undertake decisive action for the benefit of all, particularly the poorest and most vulnerable.
35. Mr. Sparber (Liechtenstein) said that climate change and ecosystem destruction were already affecting human beings and, if not addressed, could have an irreversible impact on the future of the world.
Environmental pollution and climate change ignored boundaries; they required collective action as a matter of urgency, in line with Goal 7 of the MDGs.

While the Group of Twenty and other forums could provide valuable input in that process, a substantial compromise ultimately depended on the political will of the negotiating partners.
He therefore urged the States Parties to the Framework Convention to adopt a pragmatic approach in the forthcoming negotiations in Cancún, in the interests of the efficient multilateralism that determined the primary global governance role of the United Nations.

38. Ms. Al-Hadid (Jordan) said that, as a country whose semi-arid climate made it highly dependent on scarce water resources, Jordan was severely affected by the impacts of climate change, to which, however, it contributed relatively little.
The global response to that phenomenon should be negotiated on the basis primarily of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol.
Moreover, access to clean and renewable energy offered a key to ecologically, economically and socially sustainable development.
39. Jordan, which was at risk of a high rate of desertification, was seeking to counter that risk through its National Action Programme.

Her Government had therefore taken steps to conserve the many threatened species and habitats through a national network of protected areas and by monitoring the country's wildlife and carrying out strategic environmental assessments as a means of promoting sustainable development.
40. Mr. Rajabi (Islamic Republic of Iran) said that sustainable development was a well-defined concept. Eradicating poverty, changing unsustainable patterns of production and consumption, and protecting and managing the natural resource base were essential for sustainable development.
41. However, sustainable development was not merely a question of environmental issues.
The United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in 2012 was an opportunity to address past failures and to identify ways for the United Nations system to increase capacity-building support for national sustainable development plans and strategies in developing countries.

The post-Kyoto arrangements must also examine that problem closely in order to identify its root causes and eradicate it.
43. By 2020, 135 million people risked being driven from their lands because of continuing desertification; approximately 70 per cent of drylands utilized for agriculture were already degraded and at risk of desertification.
Insufficient financial resources, a lack of institutional capacity and limited access to efficient clean technology were among the major problems that prevented developing countries from tackling those challenges.
Nevertheless, if no countermeasures were taken, desertification in drylands threatened to reverse development gains in some regions.
44. Mr. Sorreta (Philippines) noted the increasing relevance of sustainable development discussions in the context of global concerns about climate change, biodiversity loss, deforestation, desertification and the combined effects of those phenomena on ecosystem stability, food security and the very existence of nations.

46. Lastly, he stressed that the problems under discussion, which were equally important, must be treated in a comprehensive and coordinated manner and with due regard for their urgency and the limited resources available.
47. Mr. Wangchuk (Bhutan) said that his country's development philosophy of Gross National Happiness was consistent with the concept of sustainable development and, indeed, went beyond that by making the attainment of contentment a development goal.
His Government pursued that objective by striving to ensure equitable and sustainable socio-economic development, environmental conservation, the promotion and preservation of culture, and the establishment of good governance, all of which were supported by governmental programmes and policies.
All of Bhutan's achievements, including its peaceful emergence as the youngest democracy, had resulted from the pursuit of happiness.
48. The MDGs and the pursuit of happiness were mutually supportive.

51. The unique challenges which small island developing States faced in their efforts to achieve sustainable development had been further exacerbated by climate change.
Accordingly, the strong political commitment to assist those countries expressed by the global community at the High-level Review Meeting on the implementation of the Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States must be backed by action.
52. The lack of progress on promises made in Copenhagen at the fifteenth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was undermining the level of trust required for a substantive and constructive dialogue on climate change.
India was among the countries most seriously affected by climate change and would continue to advocate in Cancún for an ambitious and equitable outcome based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.
Small island developing States in particular urgently required financial and technical support for climate change adaptation and mitigation.

53. It was essential to make relevant technology transfers available to developing countries on concessional and preferential terms.
To that end, the international community must be willing to balance rewards for innovators with the common good of all people, and introduce necessary flexibilities in the intellectual property rights regime.
In that connection, an informal ministerial dialogue on climate technologies, organized by India, Mexico and the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, would be convened in New Delhi in November 2010 to address many related issues.

62. Her country was eager to share its expertise and experience with other members of the international community and to adopt methods, technologies and practices that had proved useful elsewhere.
Israel's active participation as a member of the Bureau of the Commission on Sustainable Development since 2006 had spurred it to establish a centre for sustainable development through international environmental cooperation, which worked to achieve the goals of the United Nations Conventions on Desertification, Biodiversity and Climate Change.
63. Israel placed particular emphasis on combating desertification by living in harmony with the natural environment and retaining its delicate ecosystems.
In December 2010, her country would host the Third International Conference on Drylands, Deserts and Desertification: The Route to Restoration, which would be accompanied by relevant side events.
64. Her delegation welcomed the establishment by the Man and the Biosphere Programme of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) of a sub-network of dryland biosphere reserves, which had the potential to become a powerful instrument for promoting international cooperation on dryland development and on combating desertification.

It also encouraged the incorporation of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment methodology as a tool to promote the MDGs.
65. Mr. Mnisi (Swaziland) said that his country experienced incessant droughts, wildfires and windstorms and received only sporadic rainfall.
Those problems severely undermined its social and economic development; had a particularly devastating impact on its agribusiness sector, which was the backbone of the economy; were hampering its efforts to achieve the MDGs; and had reversed much of the progress that Swaziland had made in its efforts to combat poverty and unemployment.
66. In view of the ominous threat which climate change posed to mankind's very survival, it was imperative that the forthcoming Cancún Climate Change Conference should adopt a morally and legally binding post-Kyoto agreement on greenhouse gas emissions that took into account the common but differentiated responsibilities of countries.

The international community must redouble its efforts in Cancún to reach a legally binding and comprehensive agreement that reflected the principles set out in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
72. The High-level meeting of the General Assembly as a contribution to the International Year of Biodiversity had provided a valuable opportunity for Governments to review and update their biodiversity preservation strategies, which were threatened by economic forces that showed scant regard for future generations.
His delegation also welcomed the adoption at the recent tenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity of the Strategic Plan of the Convention for the period 2011-2020, the strategy for resource mobilization and the protocol on access and benefit-sharing.
73. Desertification was one of the most serious forms of environmental degradation.
His delegation therefore supported the recommendation of the Bureau of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification that the General Assembly should consider convening a high-level event on desertification in September 2011 in anticipation of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in 2012.

75. Future discussions should focus on some of the most relevant and urgent reforms.
For example, the science-policy interface should be further strengthened within the reformed governance system, so as to provide a solid basis for informed decision-making and coherent policy creation.
In that respect, broader use must be made of experience gained from other processes, such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and other UNEP multi-stakeholders assessments.
Such reform should ensure a responsive and cohesive approach to meeting country-specific needs, since the implementation of international environmental priorities was possible only if properly translated to the national level.
76. The green economy should support, rather than replace, the social, economic and environmental pillars of sustainable development.

The sad plight of the Aral Sea was a good example of the failure to abide by those principles.
84. He noted that the adoption of General Assembly resolution 64/198 at the previous session had led to the successful holding of the High-level International Conference on the Midterm Comprehensive Review of the Implementation of the International Decade for Action, "Water for Life", 2005-2015, which had been convened in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, on 8 and 9 June 2010.
All participants at the Conference had agreed on the following points: integrated water resources management was central to meeting social, environmental and economic needs in an equitable manner; and sustainable and efficient water resources management could play a crucial role in ensuring equal access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation.
The main outcome was the recognition of the need to improve cooperation and strengthen mutual trust, including through joint approaches to water resources management at the local, national and regional levels.
86. Guided by those principles, his delegation intended to submit a draft resolution to the Committee (A/C.2/65/L.25) to declare 2012 the International Year of Water Diplomacy.

92. His country would also continue to be actively engaged in global efforts to reach a post-2012 climate agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, taking into account the outcome of the fifteenth session of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention in Copenhagen.
However, the stabilization of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere would be possible only with the participation of all members of the international community, bearing in mind the extent to which they contributed to climate change and their current abilities to combat it.
Moreover, the fight against global warming should be seen in a broader context of efforts to develop a green and low-carbon economy, which required a qualitative leap forward towards energy efficiency and resource conservation.

The additional expenditures incurred for disaster preparedness would ultimately be lower than those required to rebuild destroyed infrastructure.
In that context, his delegation called for swift progress to achieve the objectives set forth in the outcome documents of the World Conference on Disaster Reduction held in Hyogo in 2005.
95. Ms. Štiglic (Slovenia), speaking on behalf of the Green Group, comprising Cape Verde, Costa Rica, Iceland, Singapore, Slovenia and the United Arab Emirates, said that the Group aimed to draw attention to challenges such as climate change, sustainable water management and the need to promote renewable energy, which all required effective global governance.
Global warming was a key challenge that affected every aspect of sustainable development, including global interdependence and the need for concerted international efforts.
In view of the catastrophic consequences of unmitigated climate change, the Group called on all countries to contribute to a successful outcome in Cancún, as an important step towards reaching a global, comprehensive and legally binding agreement to address climate change.

96. Water issues should be given more visibility, since water management played a central role in climate change adaptation and was a nexus between economic development and environmental sustainability.
Climate change had a direct impact on the natural water cycle and the availability of water resources.
The lack of water was a reality for one in three people in the world and its scarcity would further increase the likelihood of conflicts.
The Group therefore stressed the importance of improving water management through good policies, technological improvements and grass-roots behavioural changes.

Since tourism posed many environmental and sociocultural challenges to host communities, her Government had taken concrete steps to implement key elements of the Code, particularly those relating to sustainable tourism development and protection of the environment and socio-cultural heritage.
104. Sustainable tourism development required empowering communities to make decisions that took into consideration the long-term economy and the environment while ensuring equal opportunities for all stakeholders.
In that regard, her country had developed a people-centred ecotourism policy and action plan; had established several successful partnerships between the public and private sectors, as well as among non-governmental organizations and host communities; and had adopted legislation to ensure a healthy environment, to preserve natural resources and to improve the quality of life for everyone within its borders.
The Wild Life Act currently protected over 6 per cent of the national territory.
105. Recent flooding in several countries in West Africa had shown that climate change was an issue of the present and not just the future.

Despite repeated General Assembly resolutions (61/194, 62/188, 63/211 and 64/195) calling on Israel to assume its responsibility for prompt and adequate compensation to the Government of Lebanon and other countries directly affected by the oil slick, such as the Syrian Arab Republic, Israel had yet to acknowledge its responsibilities, a matter regarding which the Secretary-General had expressed grave concern in his most recent report on the matter (A/65/278).
107. Israel's failure to implement the relevant General Assembly resolutions in blatant defiance of the will of the international community was an inseparable part of its policy of non-compliance with international resolutions.
During the current session the Assembly must therefore make every effort to convey to Israel its clear condemnation and outright rejection of such hostile and irresponsible behaviour, and reiterate the demand that Israel assume responsibility for prompt and adequate compensation to Lebanon and the Syrian Arab Republic for the environmental damage caused by the spread of the oil slick.
108. Mr. Mohamed (Maldives) said that small island developing States were continually challenged by a lack of financial, technical and human resources.
The global financial crisis had affected them particularly adversely owing to their openness to the global economy and their reliance on a narrow range of income-generating industries such as tourism.

Many small island developing States relied heavily on exports and imports of essential goods, which made them extremely vulnerable to external shocks such as upheavals in commodity markets.
109. The commitments made in 2005 at the International Meeting to Review the Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States remained largely unfulfilled.
His delegation therefore urged all development partners to honour all commitments related to those States without delay.
110. Country-specific profiles should be developed to account for the special vulnerabilities of small island developing States.
For example, their accession to the World Trade Organization should be facilitated but they should also receive special consideration in trading arrangements owing to their limited ability fully to integrate into the global economy.

40. As part of the activities included in the second Plan of Action against the sexual exploitation of children and adolescents, the association ACIM/ECPAT Spain devised a proposed methodology which could be used to establish a general diagnosis of the situation as regards the commercial sexual exploitation of children in Spain.
This project has received the technical and financial support of the Ministry of Labour of Social Affairs through subsidies taken from personal income tax revenue for 2005 and 2006.
This initial model was introduced and its first phase applied in the city of Barcelona, as part of a study presented at a conference organized by UNICEF in Barcelona in March 2007 with the participation of child protection agencies of several Autonomous Communities.
The conclusions reached have provided more accurate information regarding the type of measures which might be needed in any future instrument to combat the commercial sexual exploitation of children, apart from offering practical measures for dealing with the problem in the city of Barcelona itself.
41. The basic objective of this campaign is to create public awareness of the issue of the commercial sexual exploitation of children.

The preventive awareness campaigns are mainly intended for men and women tourists travelling to destinations where sexual tourism is common practice (such as regions of the Caribbean, Central America and South and South-East Asia), or using the services of tourist operators at those destinations.
The key messages put across in the material (pamphlets, videos for showing on aircraft, informative posters) are of two kinds: the first is that the sexual exploitation of children violates the most elementary rights of children, causing them serious physical and psychological harm, and the second, that the sexual abuse of minors is a serious offence, which may be tried either in the country where it is committed or in the tourist's country of origin (in this case Spain).
50. The programme encourages public administrations, tourist agencies, children's NGOs and international organizations (such as ECPAT and WTO) to strengthen and raise the level of involvement they demonstrated in earlier activities.
(c) Evaluating the current situation and agreeing on and implementing proposed action for a more effective involvement of agencies in the fight against the commercial sexual exploitation of children in Spain.

52. It is estimated that the impact of the campaign "There can be no excuses" has reached 370,000 persons, who have either discovered or received direct information about the campaign through its distributed materials (especially leaflets, radio advertisements, banners and websites).
53. This programme began in 2004, with funding from the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, and has continued until this year.
54. Apart from these beneficiaries, the impact of the campaign has been felt by the media, especially following the presentation of the report on "The attitude of Spanish society towards the practice of the commercial sexual exploitation of children in travel" on 17 January 2007 (with 163 known hits in the media in the following two days, and on national television channels at peak hours).
The total coverage of these impacts has been conservatively estimated at 2,050,000 persons.

(b) To facilitate the training of professionals on the subject of the sexual abuse of children and to offer them access to specialized information;
(c) To promote interdisciplinary working networks and joint action programmes.
59. One of the basic objectives of the programme is to build up a nationwide working network centred on Save the Children, as well as to improve professional and social action in the area of the sexual abuse of children.
In 2005, Save the Children organized a round table in the framework of the "Joint Action Programmes in cases of sexual abuse of children", whose final report was submitted to the Children's Watch Working Group on the Ill-treatment of Children.
60. In 2006, Save the Children also initiated a project, which was awarded a prize and funding by Panda Software, to hold a round table on "Identification of children victims of abuse on the Internet".

The idea is to draw attention to and identify children appearing in pornographic material, in order to locate them and afford them adequate protection, apart from arresting their aggressors.
This round table was held in Vitoria in December 2006 and is part of the work on this subject which the European Save the Children group has been undertaking since the beginning of 2006.

The projects eligible for funding include those related to children and adolescents: analysis and diagnosis of systems of aid to children and adolescents; activities to create awareness among and train agents, professionals and/or volunteers; new contents and services related to children and adolescents (prevention, assistance, education and counselling using the new information technologies); and dissemination programmes on the safe use of the Internet.
64. The Ministry of Industry runs an Internet website for children and parents, www.chaval.es, which offers games specially selected for children, as well as information, advice and security tools for parents.
The National Institute of Communication Technologies (INTECO), attached to the Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Trade, runs a centre for response to information technology incidents and an information centre for the dissemination for a culture of security, whose objectives are to prevent, detect and respond to security incidents.
66. It is also worth mentioning that the Spanish Committee for UNICEF (in conjunction with IUNDIA) and the Universidad Carlos III of Madrid, with funding provided by the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs through the annual subsidies derived from personal income tax revenue, recently prepared a study on "Self regulation?
Protection and defence of the rights of children on the Internet".

(a) Description of the current situation as regards the use of the Internet by young persons, listing potential risks and contemplating the possibility of self-regulation in the private sector as one factor which could make the Internet environment more secure for children;
(b) The reality of the Internet seen through the eyes of a young user, both as a consumer of contents and as a participant in communication;
(c) Recommendations on various aspects.
68. The study was able to identify many web pages with contents that were if not illegal at least harmful for the proper development of young persons.
69. In the light of the findings, a series of recommendations are made to public institutions, families and network operators so that, working together, they may establish a framework of action to avoid abuses and so that the Internet may be promoted as a leisure, development and education medium for children and adolescents.

This bill extends article 181 of the Code by setting heavier penalties for sexual abuses perpetrated on children under the age of 13 within the framework of organized crime.
The same age criterion applies to penalties imposed for inducement or violent or threatening instigation to enter into prostitution or to maintain children under the age of 13 in prostitution, with even heavier penalties in the event that the life or health of the minor or disabled person involved has been endangered in any way.
71. With regard to these offences perpetrated against children or disabled persons, not only are the penalties increased on the grounds that the victim is aged under 13, but also it is expressly established that the penalties for these offences stand, regardless of any further penalties that may apply for the sexual attacks or abuses committed against those minors and disabled persons.

72. This has been a matter of considerable concern for the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for a number of years, and much discussion has taken place regarding the different possibilities of action at meetings of the interautonomous commissions organized with the Autonomous Communities and within Children's Watch.
The latter has set up an ad hoc working group to analyse the causes underlying the illegal immigration of foreign children and young persons, to coordinate the response of all the agencies involved from the time such a minor is identified on Spanish territory, to ensure immediate appropriate care for the protection of the minor by the competent bodies of the Autonomous Communities and to consider the possibility of either allowing such children entry to Spain, or returning them to their countries of origin.
73. All these activities conducted jointly by the various institutions concerned led to the drafting of an Action Procedure, listing all the different procedural stages required by law (article 92 of Royal Decree 2393/2004, of 30 December, approving the Regulation of Organic Act 4/2000, of 11 January, on the rights and freedoms of aliens in Spain and their social integration), facilitating inter-agency coordination and ensuring observance of the principle of the best interest of the child.
74. This very complex problem has to be seen of course against the broad spectrum of the rights, interests and needs of these immigrant minors and their families who, often attracted by adventure or the search for "El Dorado", are willing to risk their lives and fall victims to networks of traffickers engaged in the exploitation of minors.

76. This agreement has two objectives:
(a) Dealing with the issue of unaccompanied Romanian minors located on Spanish territory, who are exposed to the danger of abuse, exploitation and the perpetration of offences, as well as preventing such situations;
73. All these activities conducted jointly by the various institutions concerned led to the drafting of an Action Procedure, listing all the different procedural stages required by law (article 92 of Royal Decree 2393/2004, of 30 December, approving the Regulation of Organic Act 4/2000, of 11 January, on the rights and freedoms of aliens in Spain and their social integration), facilitating inter-agency coordination and ensuring observance of the principle of the best interest of the child.

82. On 15 June 2007 the Council of Ministers approved a bill currently before parliament amending Organic Act 6/1985, of 1 July, of the Judiciary, in order to allow the prosecution outside Spanish territory of the illegal trafficking of persons and clandestine immigration.
In this way Spain can take legal action against the clandestine trafficking of persons, while offering the necessary humane treatment to immigrants and protecting their rights, in response to the flow of migrants to our country, which is due to a large extent to the increased activities of organized crime groups that set their lives and security at risk.
83. A further bill has been tabled before parliament concerning international adoption, which is intended to strengthen the legal security of minors and adopting parents.
Thus the explanatory preamble of the bill establishes that "this new law considers international adoption to be a measure for the protection of minors who are deprived of a family in their countries of origin, while it provides the necessary and appropriate guarantees to ensure that international adoptions comply above all with the best interests of children and respect for their rights.
The aim is also to avoid and prevent the abduction, sale and trafficking of children, while ensuring that they suffer no discrimination on the grounds of birth, nationality, race, sex, disability or illness, religion, language, culture or opinions or on account of any other personal, family or social circumstance".

84. Lastly it is worth mentioning the appointment, since November 2006, of a divisional prosecutor responsible for coordinating all matters concerning immigration, under the authority of the Government Prosecutor's Office.
With this appointment the Prosecutor's Office aims to introduce a uniform and coordinated response in this area by all Spanish prosecutors.
9. Given that assistance for adolescent victims of exploitation is one of the principal objectives of the second National Plan of Action, please inform the Committee of the social reintegration assistance as well as physical and psychosocial recovery measures available for victims of offences covered by the Protocol and the State budget allocations for this purpose.
85. In fact the "protection and care of children and adolescents victims of exploitation" constitutes general objective No. 4 of the second Plan of Action against the sexual exploitation of children and adolescents (2006-2009).
This objective was confirmed with the approval by the Council of Ministers of the National Strategic Plan for Childhood and Adolescence 2006-2009, whose objective No. 6 is "to foster social action and care for children and adolescents in a situation of risk, exposure or disability and/or in a situation of social exclusion, subject to assessable shared criteria of quality and best practices".

86. It is worth noting that in Spain the Public Child Protection Authority (an administrative body of the Autonomous Communities), in each territory, is responsible for taking action in the event of children being exposed or unprotected.
The professional teams working with that authority consider each case individually and the related family situation and decide on the best course of action, either providing support to the family or taking over the guardianship or custody of the child.
Should the public authority assume guardianship or custody, the public administration becomes responsible for providing whatever assistance or treatment is needed for the child's physical and psychosocial recovery.

87. There appears to be agreement, nevertheless, regarding the need for greater professional specialization when it comes to evaluating cases and dealing with minors who have been the victims of sexual abuse or exploitation.
The investigation of a suspected case of sexual abuse is a demanding task, which requires specialized knowledge and experience in order to evaluate the problem in all its aspects, without overlooking details which might be overlooked by people who are not familiar with this particular type of ill-treatment.
88. Requests for investigation of these types of cases are sent in by very different sources, such as child protection services, family prevention and support services, the courts, police, hospitals, health centres, educational centres, community welfare services, family care teams, women's centres, non-governmental organizations or services caring for victims.

92. The training of professionals who come into contact with child victims of the offences under the Optional Protocol and in general with any child who is at risk or unprotected is a priority for all public administrations. The need for proper training for the different types of professionals working with children is reflected in practical applications such as the second Plan of Action against sexual exploitation and the Strategic National Plan for Children and Adolescents.
93. Since these problems are multifaceted, contact and coordination mechanisms must be provided to allow for exchanges of views and mutual advice.
This task is being performed by Children's and Adolescents' Watch, through activities of research, awareness, training and exchange of experiences.
94. Each professional sector of course has its own continuous training systems and a constant effort has to be made to update their contents in line with new areas of activity in Spain such as the sexual exploitation of children.
95. For example, the police force includes a training division of the General Directorate of National Police, which is responsible for giving specialized training to police officials.

Republic of Nauru
28. This project will make a significant difference for Nauruan people and represents a valuable opportunity for the State to advance its social and economic development to ensure Nauru's long-term sustainability.
Secondary phosphate mining in Nauru will only last for a few more years; therefore, this project will provide a significant potential income source that will assist in that transition phase.
29. Nauru relies on foreign aid and support as well as imported food, resulting in significant health issues in the State.
Importantly, Nauru's own land resources have been significantly depleted due to overharvesting of its phosphate deposit by other countries and there is little arable land remaining.

Essentially, this project represents an opportunity for the mining industry to give back to Nauru.
The State is also interested in participating in activities in the Area as Nauru does not have any commercially prospective non-living sea floor minerals in its exclusive economic zone.
30. Nauru will particularly benefit from training and capacity-building from this new industry in Nauru given that this area has been identified as a national incapacity in Nauru's National Sustainable Development Strategy 2005-2025.
The training provided by Nauru Ocean Resources in partnership with the Nauru Education and Training Foundation will particularly benefit Nauru's young people, who will over time be employed in the project or serve as advisers to the State.

The training provided by Nauru Ocean Resources in partnership with the Nauru Education and Training Foundation will particularly benefit Nauru's young people, who will over time be employed in the project or serve as advisers to the State.
Exploration for the benefit of mankind
To further minimize the offshore operations' carbon footprint, other renewable energy sources such as wind turbines and wave energy will be considered for incorporation into a mining platform.
NORI's technical alliance includes world leading experts in OTEC and Offshore Wind Energy, including John Halkyard, Jon Machin and Eric Jackson, who have all been involved with the Lockheed Martin OTEC Project.
NORI technical alliance member Charles Morgan was also involved in carrying out the environmental assessment and permitting plan for the Lockheed Martin OTEC Project.
36. By designing and developing these innovative clean energy solutions, NORI will be contributing significantly to reducing the carbon footprint of the whole polymetallic nodule mining industry and will be developing technologies that other Authority contractors can also use.
Moreover, the research and development undertaken by NORI during exploration will provide benefits to the world even if polymetallic nodule harvesting does not prove economically viable, because these renewable energy technologies will have applications far beyond polymetallic nodule mining.

For example, OTEC represents a valuable opportunity for Pacific Island States to generate much needed electricity and an opportunity for this renewable energy source to replace the current carbon polluting diesel and oil fired power generators of many Pacific Island States.
Indeed, the Republic of Nauru previously set a world record for power output from an OTEC system where the power was sent to a real power grid.
NORI will leverage Nauru's previous OTEC experience and NORI's own world leading OTEC expertise to optimize the engineering and design.
Environmentally and socially advantageous mineral supply

37. As alluded to in article 150 of the Convention, the supply of more accessible and affordable raw materials is critical to promoting economic development, particularly in developing States.
Indeed, the products of polymetallic nodules -- manganese, nickel and copper -- are basic ingredients essential for economic and social growth.

Indeed, the products of polymetallic nodules -- manganese, nickel and copper -- are basic ingredients essential for economic and social growth.
Highlighting the importance to the future of mankind of polymetallic nodules (28 per cent manganese and 1 per cent copper), it can be noted that manganese is the fourth most used metal in the world and copper is the third (iron and aluminium are first and second).
As the world population continues to grow and developing States pursue a transition to industrialized economies, the demand for these metals will continue to rise.
However, if demand increases without a commensurate increase in supply the price of these metals will become unaffordable to the majority of people in the world.
Indeed, supply on land is not keeping pace with demand and the grade (percentage) of metal in the ore mined on land is dropping as the superior higher grade material has previously been mined.

In contrast to terrestrial mining, sea floor mining involves minimal overburden and stripping, decreased extraction waste, minimal production infrastructure and no deforestation.
Indeed, every year that nickel is not produced from the sea floor means another year that virgin rainforests are stripped to obtain the metal from nickel laterites which occur predominantly in the equatorial regions.
In contrast to sea floor polymetallic nodules that occur on the abyssal plains which are the most common environment on the planet, nickel laterites occur in unique tropical rainforests which are rapidly being depleted across the globe.
38. To assist in the discussion of whether to allow mining of sea floor polymetallic nodules, NORI is conducting a study comparing the environmental and social effects of mining polymetallic nodules and the current alternative of degradation and stripping of rainforests under land-based mining of nickel laterites.
This study recognizes that developing States are demanding increasing quantities of metal and the supply of metal needs to grow which poses the question of where should future supplies come from.

The systems governed by the Juvenile Justice Act and the Act on the Treatment of Protected Juveniles had been improved, and overcrowding in juvenile reformatories had diminished significantly since 2005.
The Chairperson (Country Rapporteur) informed the Committee that the session was being filmed and would be available for viewing online.
While the Committee welcomed the progress made since 2003, there were still many shortcomings in the observance of the Convention, and the State party not yet put a number of the Committee's 2003 recommendations into effect.
Children were not always considered to be rights-holders, and the law did little to promote children's rights.
He urged the State party to re-examine the legislative options that would allow it to withdraw its reservation to article 40, paragraph 2 (b)(v), and asked whether the reservation to article 21, subparagraph (a), would be rescinded with the promulgation of the new adoption act in August 2011.

What progress had been made in decentralizing the human rights monitoring bodies beyond the three existing regional offices?
Ms. Al-Shehail (Country Rapporteur) said that, despite the State party's remarkable economic growth, in the 2009 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) family database, the Republic of Korea was ranked the lowest among all OECD member States in terms of budget allocations for child welfare.
She therefore asked whether the Government planned to increase the proportion of its budget that it allocated to that end.

It would appear that the mandate of the Children's Rights Monitoring Centre was renewed every three years, depending on its performance. It would be useful to know whether any steps had been taken to change that short-term approach and ensure the Centre's continuity.
Given that the Committee had been unable to assess the State party's implementation of the Convention on the basis of the statistical data that had been submitted in the report, she asked whether the Government planned to establish a comprehensive statistical system to measure the implementation of the Convention.

Mr. Kim Seung-kwon (Republic of Korea) said that, as the Commission did not have a department devoted specifically to children's rights, the Centre undertook that role in a complementary capacity and the system as a whole was working well.
Ms. Sandberg asked how the ombudspersons monitored the observance of children's rights in practice.
After establishing the Centre, the Government had decided that, since recognition and parental understanding of children's rights in Korean society were poor, a group of ombudspersons to monitor respect for children's rights was needed.
The Centre provided support to the ombudspersons.

The ombudspersons submitted a report to the Centre, met every three months, and apprised the Government of their findings.
During those meetings, the child participants' right to voice their opinions and to be heard was fully respected.
Ms. Rhee Won-hee (Republic of Korea) said that many opportunities were provided for children to exercise their rights.
For example, the provisions of the Child Welfare Act took the best interests of the child into consideration and the rights to express an opinion and to be heard were exercised during an annual children's conference.
The Government worked to ensure that the opinions expressed at the conference were reflected in child policies.

Twitter, Facebook and other social networking sites were also used by children.
With regard to budget allocations for children's services, the figures might appear low, but it should be noted that funds were divided among the different ministries.
For example, under the Ministry of Health and Welfare budget, 270 billion won had been allocated for assistance to children in need, 2.5 trillion won had been allocated for day-care centres and children's facilities, and the youth-related budget of the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family was 540 billion won.
The Chairperson said that the budget for children's services was clearly insufficient.
The significant amounts allocated to education were laudable, but investing the majority of available funds in education deprived the organizations working to protect all children's rights of much-needed resources.

What steps was the Government intending to take to increase the proportion of funds allocated for the protection of children's rights in order to bring it into line with allocations in other countries with comparable levels of wealth and resources to those of the Republic of Korea?
Ms. Maurás Pérez suggested that the Republic of Korea might structure its budget so that the different budget lines allocated to children's services through the various ministries and institutions would be clearly outlined, which would make it easier to assess the total amount of investment in children's services.

She sought clarification on whether the monitoring body had a specific, independent budget line under the national budget or not.
If so, how much was the budget allocation?
Ms. Rhee Won-hee (Republic of Korea) said that the total budget for children was over 87 trillion won.
That figure included funds for children in need and for childcare services as well as youth-related budgets.
The Government funded the Children's Rights Monitoring Centre and other organizations, but they remained independent.

The new laws on adoption and the jurisdiction of the family courts would come into force in 2012 - 2013.
A 2005 study on domestic legislation and of the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Cooperation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption had informed the amendments to the adoption laws passed in August 2011.
The amendments strengthened measures to prevent domestic violence against children, barred persons with criminal records from adopting and changed provisions regarding access to information about biological parents.
The dissolution of adoption had been made possible in cases of child abuse, and children, even if under 13 years of age, would have their opinion taken into account during the adoption process.
While the increase in domestic adoption had not been as great as expected, cultural attitudes to adoption were changing, and comprehensive reforms aimed at making greater use of foster care and group homes were being instituted.

Some obstacles to ratification of the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Cooperation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption remained, but work was being done in that regard.
An inter-agency task force had thus far held three meetings on preparing for ratification.

Ms. Nores de García asked whether the changes in the adoption process would include voluntary registration of children, which could then lead to direct adoptions, and whether economic support would be provided to single mothers so that they would not have to give up their children for adoption.
Mr. Kotrane said that the State party had made it clear that many changes were needed prior to ratification of the Hague convention on intercountry adoption.
However, the nature of an international convention was such that the changes required to fully observe its provisions could be made after ratification; the necessary changes in attitudes in society would then follow.
The Chairperson said that a birth registration system that allowed adoptive parents to register the child themselves would not work, since there would be no control over the process and no clear way of knowing what form of consent had been given for the adoption.

The Chairperson said that a birth registration system that allowed adoptive parents to register the child themselves would not work, since there would be no control over the process and no clear way of knowing what form of consent had been given for the adoption.
Such a system would remove judicial oversight from the process and prevent adopted children from knowing their origin and perhaps even from learning that they had been adopted.
The Committee was very concerned by the significant difference in the figures for official and unofficial adoptions.

The Committee was very concerned by the significant difference in the figures for official and unofficial adoptions.
He asked whether the State party intended to change the birth registration system in order to control adoptions more strictly and give the process transparency.
Ms. Rhee Won-hee (Republic of Korea) said that parents or medical doctors could register a birth, and the huge majority of births in the Republic of Korea took place in a medical setting.
Cultural attitudes were such that adoptive parents might not wish others to know that their child was adopted; there had, however, been an increase in the disclosure of adoptions, which was being encouraged.
The differing rates of official and unofficial adoption were recognized.

The survey results and statistics from NGOs and not-for-profit organizations were being studied further to uncover the reasons for the high abortion rate.
Single mothers were offered group homes and special facilities.
The Chairperson asked for information on the status of the bill on migrant children.
What action was planned to address the problems encountered in registering such children and the work restrictions that migrant youths faced?
He was concerned by the fact that there was no time limit on the detention of migrant children who were awaiting repatriation; even children under 10 years of age had been held in detention.

He was concerned by the fact that there was no time limit on the detention of migrant children who were awaiting repatriation; even children under 10 years of age had been held in detention.
The Committee was particularly concerned at the administrative nature of such detention, which meant that there were no regular checks and that the legitimacy of such detention orders was not subject to review.
Further information on the situation of migrant children held in detention would be appreciated.
Migrant children also experienced discrimination in education, since the submission of identification papers at school could lead to the discovery by the authorities that their parents were in the country illegally.
The Committee deplored the decision taken in 2007 to lower the age of criminal responsibility from 12 to 10 years of age and doubted whether that measure had had any positive effect.
Ms. Al-Shehail, noting that the figures supplied by the State party indicated that child abuse was on the rise, asked what action was being taken to prevent such abuse, especially physical abuse.

Details on efforts to effectively prosecute perpetrators of child sex abuse, including abuse in the context of prostitution and trafficking in persons, would also be useful, as would information on the percentage of the total budget that was allocated to preventing abuse and reintegrating victims into society.
The periodic report indicated that there was a high and rising suicide rate among Korean children.
It would be appreciated if the State party could provide detailed information on early detection and treatment programmes and other action to address the problem.
Mr. Kotrane, reiterating his concerns about child labour, said that the periodic report indicated that increasing numbers of children were in employment in the Republic of Korea.

In the light of evidence that children were working excessive hours, working without breaks and had been subjected to verbal, physical and sexual abuse at work, he wondered whether the Government of the Republic of Korea intended to take action to protect such children.
Information in the report indicated that the majority of workplaces that had been inspected were found to be in breach of labour laws, which led him to ask what action the State party intended to take to ensure compliance with article 32 of the Convention and other international norms.
The express criminalization of the act of enlisting children in armed conflict was also recommended.
Further information on the progress of those amendments would be appreciated.
Mr. Cardona Llorens asked for clarification on the law on children and disability that had been referred to by the delegation.

Mr. Cardona Llorens asked for clarification on the law on children and disability that had been referred to by the delegation.
It was not clear whether that was a new law or whether it was in fact the same law that had been described in the 2007 report, which had not yet been brought into force.
Children with disabilities had increasingly been attending regular schools; however, most of those children were still taught in special classes, meaning that the majority of children with disabilities were not fully integrated into the mainstream education system.
If the situation had not changed since the writing of the State party's report, then he would suggest that the State party should make every effort to remedy that situation.

Ms. Sandberg said that she would be interested to know more about the fate of a child whose parents were detained in a public shelter because they were unregistered workers.

The situation in the Middle East
Measures to eliminate international terrorism
This week marked the fifth anniversary of Israel's complete withdrawal from southern Lebanon.
Israel's total withdrawal from southern Lebanon in May 2000 was in full compliance with Security Council resolution 425 (1978) and has been confirmed inter alia by the Secretary-General, by the Security Council in resolutions 1310 (2000) and 1337 (2001), and by the statement of the President of the Security Council of 18 June 2000.

Notwithstanding these positive developments, there are still reasons for concern: although Israel is in full and confirmed compliance with resolution 425 (1978), the Lebanese Government has not yet fulfilled its part of the resolution or met its obligations under the norms of international law, which call for the restoration of international peace and security and the implementation of Lebanese authority over all its territory, including the south.
The lack of Lebanese authority in its southern region, including the border area with Israel, has enabled terrorist organizations and militias to act freely.
In fact, recent months have seen a surge in the number of cross-border attacks against Israel and an increase in terrorist activity stemming from Lebanon.
Moreover, most recent inflammatory statements made by terrorist leaders operating in Lebanon risk further escalations and could jeopardize the stability of the region as a whole.
These developments reiterate the pressing need for the immediate disbanding and disarmament of all Lebanese and non-Lebanese militias operating in Lebanon.

Summary report prepared by the joint Task Force on the Health Aspects of Air Pollution of
PARTICULATE MATTER The Task Force on Health conducted a multidisciplinary analysis aiming at the assessment of health impacts of suspended particulate matter.
Special emphasis was placed on the fraction emitted by remote sources or formed from precursor gases in the atmosphere.
This report summarizes the main results of this analysis.
The analysis indicated that particulate matter (PM), especially its fine fraction (PM2.5), affected the health of a majority of the population in Europe.

This report summarizes the main results of this analysis.
The analysis indicated that particulate matter (PM), especially its fine fraction (PM2.5), affected the health of a majority of the population in Europe.
There was a led to a wide range of acute and chronic health problems and an estimated decrease in life expectancy by about one year in the most polluted countries of Europe.
The pollution from remote sources contributed significantly to the problem.
GE.05-31540 PM is an air pollutant consisting of solid and liquid particles suspended in the air.
The particles vary in size, shape, chemical composition and origin.
Their size, or aerodynamic diameter, is often used to characterize them.

The particles vary in size, shape, chemical composition and origin.
Their size, or aerodynamic diameter, is often used to characterize them.
Exposure to PM in ambient air was linked to a number of different health outcomes.
They ranged from modest transient changes in the respiratory tract and impaired pulmonary function, which increased the risk of symptoms requiring emergency room or hospital treatment, to increased risk of death from cardiovascular and respiratory diseases or lung cancer.
This evidence stemmed from studies on both acute and chronic exposure.
Toxicological experiments supported the evidence generated by epidemiological studies.
PM2.5 was found more hazardous than the coarse particles.

PM2.5 was found more hazardous than the coarse particles.
The PM10 data at urban locations in Europe, where measurements started in the 1990s, showed a decreasing trend until 1999 and an upward one since then.
PM10 concentrations in Europe followed the rural background concentrations (i.e. polluted mostly by remote sources) with local peaks related to traffic on busy roads.
Monitoring of PM2.5 was being performed at few locations only.
Data from 30 stations were available in AirBase for 2002.
PM2.5 was measured in parallel to PM10 at 19 EMEP sites.

The Islamic Republic of Iran has always been a committed member of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) regime and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear programme has been confirmed by the realities on the ground as well as various IAEA reports, which, inter alia, stress that "the Agency has been able to continue to verify the non-diversion of declared nuclear material in Iran".
Also, the Director General of IAEA has stressed in several of his statements that "there is no evidence that Iran's enrichment of uranium is intended for a military nuclear programme".
Moreover, by its robust and extensive cooperation with IAEA, the Islamic Republic of Iran has not only made it possible for the Agency to have thousands of person/day inspections of Iranian nuclear facilities, it has also concluded and implemented, with utmost seriousness, a workplan with the Agency that has led to the resolution and closure of all six outstanding issues.
The reports of IAEA, including the latest ones, clearly attest to the exclusively peaceful nature of the nuclear programme of the Islamic Republic of Iran, both in the past and at present.
The said reports also show that Iran is fully committed to its international obligations with regard to its peaceful nuclear programme and has been cooperating with the Agency in a responsible and transparent manner.

The said reports also show that Iran is fully committed to its international obligations with regard to its peaceful nuclear programme and has been cooperating with the Agency in a responsible and transparent manner.
Iran's cooperation with IAEA has gone far beyond its treaty obligations and the latest report of the Agency attests to this important fact by stating that "Since March 2007, a total of 21 unannounced inspections have been carried out at the fuel enrichment plant (FEP)".
In its reports, the Agency has also emphasized, several times, its conclusion that "Iran's statements are consistent with other information available to the Agency".
By resolving the last six outstanding issues according to the agreed workplan on the one hand, and conducting its present activities under the full and continuous monitoring of IAEA, based on the Agency's statute, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the comprehensive safeguards agreement on the other, the Islamic Republic of Iran has removed any so-called concerns or ambiguities with regard to its peaceful nuclear activities in the past and at present and therefore the distortions and allegations made against my country's peaceful nuclear programme, including those made in today's meeting of the Council, are entirely groundless.

While there is a widespread satisfaction with the DDA's performance, there are constraints on the resources it can set aside for servicing the BTWC community.
4. The BTWC and the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) both prohibit weapons of mass destruction.
Yet the way these two conventions operate is very different.
The CWC has a comprehensive programme of work and an implementation support structure, such as its own organisation with a large secretariat.
In comparison, the BTWC suffers from a serious institutional deficit.

A mechanism has to be found that can support States Parties in fulfilling their BTWC commitments without entailing additional financial obligations.
6. These concerns have been accommodated in other arms control treaties.
For example, a small implementation support unit has been developed under the Mine Ban Treaty, and has already proven its added value.
7. A support unit under the BTWC could cover the following tasks:
Being in charge of the preparations for intergovernmental meetings.

The situation in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan
On 10 December 2007 the Permanent Mission of the Republic of Armenia circulated a letter opposing the draft resolution entitled "Protracted conflicts in the GUAM area and their implications for international peace, security and development".
In this regard we would like to draw your attention to the following.
Armenia considers the draft as a step irrelevant to the ongoing peace negotiations.
Just on the contrary, the draft resolution proposed by GUAM by calling on the settlement of conflicts and restoration of peace is targeted to support the international mediation efforts.

As for the allegation of Armenia of transferring the conflicts from the OSCE to the United Nations, we would like to underline that the GUAM States are neither offering nor willing to transmit the conflicts, lasting for more than 10 years within their territories, from one organization to another.
The goal of the GUAM States is just to mobilize the support of the international community to the settlement of the protracted conflicts.
Irregardless of the fact that whether this is the United Nations or OSCE is involved to the settlement of the conflicts in the territories of the GUAM States, both of them act on and proceed from the legal basis established by the United Nations, including resolutions adopted by the Security Council related to the conflicts.

Just on the contrary, the draft resolution proposed by GUAM by calling on the settlement of conflicts and restoration of peace is targeted to support the international mediation efforts.
As for the allegation of Armenia of transferring the conflicts from the OSCE to the United Nations, we would like to underline that the GUAM States are neither offering nor willing to transmit the conflicts, lasting for more than 10 years within their territories, from one organization to another.

Women don't need only political declarations; women need adequate mechanisms, equal opportunities, adequate resources and concrete action.
We express our deep concerns about the very negative impact on the lives of women of political turbulence, globalization and militarism, the global economic and financial crisis, growing religious fundamentalism and the strengthening of patriarchal attitudes towards women.
We call for implementing commitment to reach women's empowerment.
Women's participation in political processes is crucial for reaching the Millennium Development Goals.
Women continue to be dramatically underrepresented in decision-making positions in all five Central Asian republics.

Women's participation in political processes is crucial for reaching the Millennium Development Goals.
Women continue to be dramatically underrepresented in decision-making positions in all five Central Asian republics.
It is necessary to have a uniform State programme and an effective implementation and monitoring mechanism on women's political empowerment, to include women in decision-making bodies as heads of those bodies, to allocate finances in the State budget for those purposes and to overcome conservative and patriarchal attitudes towards women's effective and full political participation.
Equal representation and participation of women and men in decision-making is one the fundamental steps for addressing social and economic issues in an integrated way.
States should: (a) include women and women's organizations into development cooperation development actors; (b) adopt and implement temporary special measures to increase the level of women's representation in all decision-making positions; (c) start gender budgeting initiatives and allocate State budget finances for women's rights; (d) attract international financial support through inclusion of women's rights in a country's priorities list.

The statement contains unsubstantiated allegations and presents a distorted picture of the civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
For the sake of truth, it is necessary to state the following.
The accusations that characterize the fratricidal civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina as a form of racism are absurd.
Serbs and Muslims who have lived together for centuries in Bosnia and Herzegovina are a people of the same ethnic origin, whose sole difference is that they belong to different religions.
Even the leader of the Bosnian Muslims, Alija Izetbegović, is of Serbian descent according to his own assertion.

By invoking "racism" while referring to the events in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Muslim delegate is deliberately misusing the said term in order to cover up the true nature of the civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
As is the case in all civil wars, horrible crimes and atrocities have been committed by all the parties to the conflict.
The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has always maintained that all those responsible for atrocities and breaches of humanitarian law in the ongoing civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as in Croatia or elsewhere, should be brought to justice.
The Yugoslav committee for gathering data on crimes committed against humanity and international law has on numerous occasions forwarded information on the war crimes committed by Muslims and Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

in the period from 1992 to 1994, the Serbs in the municipality of Goražde have been exposed to physical annihilation so that today out of 9,844 Serbs who according to 1991 census lived in Goražde only 100 remain.
The former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia survived for decades as a multi-ethnic, multicultural and multireligious State.

It has accepted all five peace plans and played a decisive role in bringing to full success the latest agreements concerning basic constitutional principles reached in Geneva and New York.

The name of the leading political party in Serbia is the Socialist Party of Serbia, which already in its title underlines that it is not a national party but a party of all the citizens of Serbia, irrespective of their national origin or religious affiliation.

Intensive consultations on the adaptation of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) are continuing “in all directions”.
In particular, we have achieved an important understanding with Ankara on the settlement of flank problems, which has met with the support of the other participants in the negotiations process.
The most important thing now is to concentrate on another key issue: ensuring strategic stability in Central Europe through arms-control mechanisms.
Efforts are being made at the bilateral level in capitals and at the multilateral level through the Russian Federation/North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and at the Vienna negotiations on the adaptation of the CFE Treaty.
The other day, an important meeting was held with the NATO high-level working group on the adaptation of the CFE Treaty, at which there was a comprehensive and frank exchange of views that made it possible to come up with a clear outline for a possible compromise.
