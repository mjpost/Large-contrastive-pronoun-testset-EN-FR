In the present case, the Committee considers that the closure of the case at the examination stage, which prevented the holding of the oral trial does not meet the requirements or thoroughness that should be applied to all reports of acts of torture, and that the only inquiries conducted at the examination stage were not sufficient to examine the facts with the rigour required by the severity of the author's illness and the reports of the doctors who treated and diagnosed her.

Once she had lodged an application with the European Court of Human Rights alleging a breach of article 3, independently and in relation to article 1 of the European Convention, which was subsequently declared inadmissible for the lack of an apparent violation of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention, the matter has been "examined under another procedure of international investigation" pursuant to the reservation cited above.

It is not for the Human Rights Committee to assess whether the examination of a case has been sufficiently careful under a procedure which enforces a norm affording an equivalent level of protection to that provided by article 7 of the Covenant, and which was invoked unsuccessfully by the author of a communication before the matter was brought to the Committee.

It would have been important, however, if the Committee would have highlighted the particular circumstances of the case in more detail.

That brings us to the particular circumstances of the present case. The Committee has noted the limited reasoning contained in succinct terms in the letter of the European Court of Human Rights to the author in which she was informed that the Court had declared her application inadmissible since the Court did not observe any apparent violation of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the (European) Convention or its Protocols.

In such cases where the physical integrity, yes indeed the right to life, of the individual complainant has been at stake, it should be clear from the record of the (inadmissibility) decision of the European Court of Human Rights that the Court has sufficiently given attention to the merits of the case in order to constitute an examination for purposes of the preclusionary effect of a reservation, like the Spanish one, to article 5, paragraph 2 (a), of the Optional Protocol.

The resulting add-on earned in respect of these projects are estimated to be approximately $17 million, an amount equal to the provision made in decision 91/32 (line 2 of annex B). This solution is therefore "cost neutral" in that no additional resources, other than those already provided for in decision 91/32, are called for.

It appears, therefore, that it will be more reasonable and useful in developing the TSS-1 programme to take into consideration the priorities and emphases of agency programmes rather than require the scheduling of one to be rigidly related to the other.

It is also intended that the process of formulation will begin in the field and be governed by the priorities and needs identified at the country level. This is in contrast with the process adopted last year, when because of shortness of time, agency headquarters were requested to provide a list of proposals as a starting point for the exercise.

While these emphases are set in the broader context of the total development effort, and therefore are not inconsistent with nor discourage assistance in the technical areas, in practice it appears that country programmes based on these areas of focus tend to concentrate on the social sectors.
