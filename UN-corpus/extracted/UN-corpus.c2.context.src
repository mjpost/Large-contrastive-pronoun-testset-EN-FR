Efforts are ongoing to ensure a comprehensive approach to the implementation of resolution 1701 (2006) that integrates the endeavours of UNIFIL, the Office of the United Nations Special Coordinator for Lebanon and the United Nations country team; to further involve the Government of Lebanon in the implementation of resolution 1701 (2006); and to further the strategic dialogue with, and increase the capacity of, the Lebanese Armed Forces. The latter is intended to facilitate the gradual assumption by the Lebanese Armed Forces of effective and sustainable security control of the UNIFIL area of operations and Lebanese territorial waters, as a key element in supporting moves towards a permanent ceasefire.
In a recent statement (S/PRST/2013/9), the President of the Security Council, speaking on behalf of the Council, highlighted the impact of the Syrian crisis on the stability and security of Lebanon and stressed the crucial role played by the Lebanese Armed Forces in responding to new security challenges, characterizing them as a central pillar of the country's stability.

The current situation of these peoples, formerly termed "natives", is a legacy of colonial history.
The treaties and conventions imposed on native peoples by the colonizers were nothing short of acts of dispossession of these peoples for the benefit of settlers, who received protection and assistance from their State of origin.

When the former colonies gained their sovereignty, they perpetuated the former system of exploitation of the lands and wealth of indigenous populations by concluding agreements with the former settlers amounting to complete dispossession without compensation, thereby condemning the indigenous population to a state of poverty.

B. Globalization and neglect of the rights of indigenous populations
20. Globalization is a new modus operandi of world capitalism, which supports the emergence of globalized firms that pursue a global approach to the design, production and distribution of their goods and services.

23. Globalization is a system in which States are weakened to an extent which even affects the exercise of their sovereignty, and where real and undivided power resides in private economic power alone.
The search for this power has resulted in the confiscation of croplands and other resources that used to belong to indigenous populations, and this pattern has survived the various phases of decolonization.

Land acquired in this manner is exploited in an uncontrolled manner by the rich and powerful; the indigenous populations are excluded, unable to claim even the smallest share of the huge revenues derived from its exploitation.
We Africans retain bitter memories of the experience of the Ogoni people in Nigeria, some of whom were sentenced to death and executed for having claimed their share of the wealth derived from the crude oil under their land. For some time now, the Bororo people of Cameroon have been unsuccessfully trying to block the passage across their crop and grazing lands of a pipeline that will make it easier to tap the country's oil wealth.

C. Poverty among indigenous people
28. Indigenous populations, which international institutions recognize as being the most vulnerable and excluded, are naturally the poorest, living as they do in the most wretched penury without hope of a future for themselves or their descendants.

This is the lesson we learn from the history of colonization, which was pursued while completely ignoring the rules of the indigenous natural environment.
30. The principal consequence of all this is the accelerated and chronic pauperization of indigenous populations, who now live in the most abject poverty for which the international community is largely to blame through the intermediary of its finance institutions.

The globalization of the economy, driven solely by the profit motive and chiefly by transnational corporations, the World Trade Organization and the international financial institutions - a process which has no social dimension - overlooks the needs, prerogatives and rights of indigenous populations.

Taking one of many possible examples, he cited the pre-sessional working group on communications, whose work at times did very little to assist the plenary, since even members of the working group sometimes called into question the validity of the draft texts the group had produced.
In those cases, the pre-sessional work of the working group wasted time and money.

There was no need to introduce more bureaucracy or complicate matters, but it was necessary to consolidate ideas on what changes were needed, within the framework of the Covenant.
Sir Nigel Rodley agreed with Mr. O'Flaherty that the Committee was constantly reviewing its working methods in order to meet the exigencies of new situations.

In the past, individual colleagues and groups of colleagues had identified areas for improvement in working methods and had produced discussion papers, which had successfully translated into revised working methods.
Depending on the issues that were identified, the plenary might best proceed either on the basis of a report, by merely taking note of an issue, or on the basis of a study by a group of Committee members, always with the input of the secretariat.

Mr. Lallah recalled that during the first years of its existence, the Committee had had a working group composed of five members to deal with all matters.
Thereafter, two working groups had been established, one to handle communications, the other to examine any issues which the plenary entrusted to it.

In order to tackle the problem of State party reports, and since consideration of reports sometimes lasted four meetings, the previous working group had introduced the idea of lists of issues in order to achieve a more focused approach.
Without written replies, the examination of a State party report would take an inordinate amount of meeting time.

The Chairperson said he understood that, prior to the introduction of the task force system, a working group had been responsible for drawing up lists of issues.
When the task force system had been adopted, that working group had disappeared, enabling the working group on communications to have 10 members.

If a working group were tasked only with identifying areas for reform, it would tell the Committee nothing new; if, on the other hand, it were requested to suggest potential solutions, it would be exceeding the mandate that such a group should have.

The difficulty lay in how to proceed, given the complexity of reform.
In particular, the Committee should reach agreement on whether to adopt an approach based on lists of issues prior to reporting before its future working methods could be determined.

If a State party had undergone major political reforms, for example, and wished to submit a full report, it must be allowed to do so.
Third, the title of the new process must reflect the fact that documents submitted by States parties in response to lists of issues prior to reporting would have the status of reports, so as to ensure that they were given priority by the translation services.

With regard to the proposed new approach to reporting, he pointed out that the issue had been discussed some years previously, in response to calls by States parties to simplify the reporting process, and that a similar solution had been proposed.
The Committee should examine whether the measures then suggested were still viable.

The text of the draft also gave both the State party and the Committee the right to insist on the use of a full report rather than the new approach.
In his view, an important issue that remained to be decided was the stage at which the new reporting system should come into effect.

Ms. Keller, responding to members' concerns and questions, said that it was important to maintain flexibility in the reporting system in view of article 40, which stipulated only that States parties should prepare initial and periodic reports, and not that those reports should comply with the format which the Committee requested.
The new approach could therefore be used only with the consent of both sides.

She reaffirmed the importance of a new heading for the section of the guidelines currently entitled "Lists of issues prior to reporting" and a new designation for the reporting approach, which should make it clear that the document produced by a State party in response to the Committee's list of issues was its report, and thus a mandated document.

In response to Mr. O'Flaherty's concern, she affirmed that Committee members would indeed retain the right to raise any question they wished under the Covenant.

Utilities should be provided with a reasonable opportunity to recover all their costs, including the costs of capital (a fair return on investment).
For the efficiency of the energy sector and the entire economy the most important factor is that prices reflect long-run marginal costs (LRMC).

Generally, such investments require a payback of no more than five years.
Rational energy use is even more important in energy-intensive sectors, iron and steel, glass, non-metallic minerals and heavy chemicals, where energy costs can account for as much as 40% of total operating costs.

It should be explained that price reform is a key element of moves to promote sustainable development, protect the environment and raise people's standard of living.
The population needs to understand that the price of all products, including energy, should reflect production and distribution costs as well as a reasonable profit to cover the cost of capital.

The population should be made to accept that energy is a commodity just like any other.
It can be particularly difficult for people to accept this principle in some countries of Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia where the majority of consumers have become used to not paying their energy bills.

In vertically integrated network industries, unbundling of the accounts and management of the different parts of the supply chain would reveal cross-subsidies and make it easier to remove them.
At the same time the regulatory body responsible for pricing should take care that the logic behind pricing and the frequency and timing of price changes are widely known and understood.

In the long run, the goal should be to move to market-based pricing through the introduction of competition in the wholesale and retail supply.
In this way, the free market would determine the price of the energy commodity, with the price being free to rise and fall in response to scarcities and surpluses.

Energy costs reflect the volume of consumed energy.
Capacity costs can be calculated for each customer category through detailed analysis of system loads, taking into account how certain customers influence such costs.

1. Definitions and Scope
The above definition encompasses a wide range of government interventions in the energy sector, but excludes non-energy government policies and measures that might nonetheless unintentionally lead to lower energy prices in an indirect way.
Government actions that primarily concern the transport sector, for example, can significantly affect the cost and price of providing an energy service.

A producer subsidy - a government intervention that has the effect of lowering the cost of production - would normally lead to a lower price to the final consumer, because it stimulates producers to raise output.
A consumer subsidy is a government action that directly reduces the price of a fuel or energy service to consumers.

Public funding of fossil-fuel research and development, a form of energy subsidy, may ultimately lead to Page 11 higher consumption, but may also yield positive environmental effects if it results in the use of more efficient, cleaner-burning technologies in the long term.
They can place a heavy burden on government finances, worsen the balance of payments and weaken the potential for economies to grow.

The financial cost may be significantly raised by the need for heavy administration to allocate subsidies to targeted beneficiaries and prevent abuse.
Subsidies to fossil fuels undermine the competitiveness of renewables and investments in energy efficiency.

Eliminating subsidies completely is justified when they are clearly harmful to the environment or impede economic development and trade while bringing minimal social or local economic benefits in the long term.
Subsidies on any economic activity can in principle be rationalized on the basis of theoretical arguments concerning market failures or imperfections that lead to economically sub-optimal outcomes.

Energy-market failures include external costs, such as pollution, and barriers to market entry that impede the efficient operation of competitive markets.
Government intervention, which may involve the use of subsidy, can help to remedy such market failures, either by addressing their causes or by trying to replicate the outcome of a perfect market.

For example, support for renewable energy sources or for the deployment of energy-efficient technologies can bring real social, environmental and economic benefits, depending on circumstances and how that support is provided.
But practical considerations can make achieving those goals difficult. In practice, policy-makers have to strike an appropriate balance between reliance on the market and intervention to address social and environmental policy goals.

Non-payment of electricity, gas and district heat bills, an implicit form of subsidy, remains a major problem in some economies in transition.
Policy makers, however, should seek to incorporate the external costs of energy production, supply and use in the prices of energy services where possible, using market-based instruments such as taxes or regulations such as limits on airborne emissions.

In most instances, governments are faced with awkward trade-offs, both between the economic, social and environmental effects of reforming subsidies and between those consumers or producers who stand to lose out and those that stand to gain.
But, in many cases, removing or reforming energy in combination with other policy measures, such as those aimed at rationalizing the tax system, could bring important net overall economic and environmental benefits.

Examples might include temporary support for new renewable and energy-efficient technologies to overcome market barriers, and measures to improve poor or rural households' access to modern, commercial forms of energy.
But the way in which a subsidy is applied is critical to how effective it is in meeting policy objectives and its cost.

The public should be able to see how much a subsidy programme costs and who benefits from it.

Targeting subsidies effectively so their benefits are limited to a clearly defined targeted group should be the first consideration in reforming or designing a subsidy programme. The targeted group would normally be a certain type of producer or category of consumer; for example, the operator of a wind turbine or poor households.
Page 14 or all consumers, regardless of their income or the form of energy cause major economic distortions and costs, and should, therefore, be avoided.

If this rate were applied only to households subscribing to the lowest capacity, for example 3 kW for electricity service, this subsidy would be largely limited to the poor.

Producer subsidies should generally be limited to renewable energy sources that bring environmental benefits and that are already close to being competitive with conventional fuels and technologies.
However, public support for research and development -- a form of subsidy -- may be justified for non-renewable energy sources if it can be shown that such support will promote more efficient and, therefore, less polluting energy use.

In the case of consumer subsidies, both the size and the subsidy mechanism affect how efficiently energy is used.
The larger the subsidy on electricity, for example, the less incentive consumers will have to conserve electricity and to use it efficiently.

In general, commodity subsidies are more likely to discourage the efficient use of energy than capacity subsidies.
Consumer subsidies in the form of government controls that keep prices below the full cost of supply or allow consumers to avoid paying their energy bills should not be allowed to penalize financially the energy-service provider.

Such subsidies, if they cause the company to lose money, will undermine its ability to maintain a reliable service and upgrade and expand the network to meet demand.
They will also discourage new investors from entering the industry.

Because subsidies can result in serious market distortions and adverse environmental, social and economic effects, it is essential that any decision to introduce or retain a subsidy should be soundly based.
Too often, a subsidy is introduced to support a specific social or environmental goal, without serious analysis of all the consequences.

The overall cost of a subsidy scheme should never be allowed to become a serious burden on the national finances.
One way of avoiding this is to place financial limits on on-budget subsidy schemes.

By its very nature, the costs of an energy subsidy are usually spread throughout the economy, while its benefits are usually enjoyed by only a small segment of the population -- not necessarily the targeted group.
Those beneficiaries will always have an interest in Page 18 defending that subsidy when their gains exceed their share of the economic or environmental costs.

Resistance to reform tends to be particularly strong in the economies in transition. In these countries, the general public often still considers energy to be a basic social good, like food and housing, the pricing of which should not be left solely to market forces.
Resistance to reform makes it especially important for policy makers to be extremely cautious in devising new subsidies.

High Commissioner for Human Rights Please find herewith enclosed* for information memorandums issued by the Palestinian National Authority on the Israeli daily aggressions against the Palestinian people in the occupied Palestinian territories, for the period from Sunday 11 to Sunday 18 August 2002, all of which constitute violations of human rights and grave violations categorized according to international humanitarian law as war crimes and crimes against humanity, particularly the continued Israeli acts of deliberate killing, house demolitions, besieging Palestinian towns, villages and camps, imposing collective punishments, severe restrictions on the movement of Palestinians and a suffocating curfew which obviously endangers the lives of thousands of Palestinian civilians who are denied access to food, water, medicine and even to hospitals for getting urgent treatment.

The key messages put across in the material (pamphlets, videos for showing on aircraft, informative posters) are of two kinds: the first is that the sexual exploitation of children violates the most elementary rights of children, causing them serious physical and psychological harm, and the second, that the sexual abuse of minors is a serious offence, which may be tried either in the country where it is committed or in the tourist's country of origin (in this case Spain).
50. The programme encourages public administrations, tourist agencies, children's NGOs and international organizations (such as ECPAT and WTO) to strengthen and raise the level of involvement they demonstrated in earlier activities.

The development of timber certification answers the growing demand for "green" products, which has led to the drawing up of a new generation of international standards, generic environmental management standards (ISO 14000 series) and many national and regional environmental standards, guidelines and certification schemes.
The purpose of this type of "eco" certification scheme is to reward producers who meet the consumer demand for environmentally friendly products by allowing them to increase sales, create new market niches or charge a price premium for such products.

37. As alluded to in article 150 of the Convention, the supply of more accessible and affordable raw materials is critical to promoting economic development, particularly in developing States.
Indeed, the products of polymetallic nodules -- manganese, nickel and copper -- are basic ingredients essential for economic and social growth.

Indeed, the products of polymetallic nodules -- manganese, nickel and copper -- are basic ingredients essential for economic and social growth.
However, if demand increases without a commensurate increase in supply the price of these metals will become unaffordable to the majority of people in the world.
Indeed, supply on land is not keeping pace with demand and the grade (percentage) of metal in the ore mined on land is dropping as the superior higher grade material has previously been mined.

38. To assist in the discussion of whether to allow mining of sea floor polymetallic nodules, NORI is conducting a study comparing the environmental and social effects of mining polymetallic nodules and the current alternative of degradation and stripping of rainforests under land-based mining of nickel laterites.
This study recognizes that developing States are demanding increasing quantities of metal and the supply of metal needs to grow which poses the question of where should future supplies come from.

Report of the Administrator
SUMMARY The present document contains a progress report on the implementation of Governing Council decisions 91/32 of 25 June 1991 and 92/22 of 26 May 1992 on agency support cost arrangements.
The report includes information on the status of the financial provisions for the new arrangements; implementation of the 1992-1993 work plan and preparation of the 1994-1995 work plan for the TSS-1 facility; status of the TSS-2 facility; some issues relating to the smaller technical agencies; and monitoring and evaluation of the new arrangements.
1. The present document contains a progress report on the status of implementation of decision 91/32 of 25 June 1991, which sets out the legislative framework for the implementation of the successor arrangements for agency support costs.

1. The present document contains a progress report on the status of implementation of decision 91/32 of 25 June 1991, which sets out the legislative framework for the implementation of the successor arrangements for agency support costs.
In addition, as requested in paragraph 27 of decision 92/22 of 26 May 1992 on national execution and agency support costs, the report also includes information on the implementation of that decision.
ARRANGEMENTS 2. As reported to the Governing Council at its thirty-ninth session in document DP/1992/23, the new support cost arrangements went into effect as of 1 January 1992.
In addition, as requested in paragraph 27 of decision 92/22 of 26 May 1992 on national execution and agency support costs, the report also includes information on the implementation of that decision.
ARRANGEMENTS 2. As reported to the Governing Council at its thirty-ninth session in document DP/1992/23, the new support cost arrangements went into effect as of 1 January 1992.
As a result of these measures, a level of $660 million of project budgets have been approved under the old arrangements, thus providing an increased level of transitionary protection to the agencies concerned.
Since 1 July 1992, all projects have been subject, on a mandatory basis, to the new arrangements.

Since 1 July 1992, all projects have been subject, on a mandatory basis, to the new arrangements.
For this purpose, the Council also authorized the Administrator to use available funds within the overall provision of resources for support cost arrangements as set out in annex I of decision 91/32.
5. Accordingly, a series of training workshops designed with professional assistance and with the active collaboration of the agencies has now been carried out in the field.

5. Accordingly, a series of training workshops designed with professional assistance and with the active collaboration of the agencies has now been carried out in the field.
The workshops were conducted by teams of trainers drawn from both UNDP and the agencies, with most of the latter drawn from the core group that has worked on the development of the new arrangements in the last two years.
7. The self-evaluations conducted at the conclusion of each workshop have judged them effective.

There has also emerged a clearer recognition of the opportunities and flexibilities provided under the new arrangements and particularly of the support services provided by the agencies.
Participants also made several recommendations for simplifications and improvements in the arrangements which, as stated in paragraph 3 above, will be reflected in revised guidelines in due course.

Additionally, the balance of liquid resources which had accumulated in the fourth cycle because of excesses of income over expenditures during the 1983-1988 period are expected to be drawn down to nearly zero at the end of 1995.
Taking all these factors into consideration, and following a detailed review, the Administrator has decided, in the interests of prudent financial planning, to establish a revised planning framework for the fifth cycle.

An amount of $17 million had been earmarked for this purpose, to be financed from unutilized resources carried over from the support cost line of the fourth programming cycle.
17. As pointed out in table 1, section 2, however, nationally executed projects approved under the old arrangements amounted to $304 million, far exceeding $140 million originally estimated.

19. Taking these factors into consideration, the Administrator proposes that the intent of paragraph 16 of decision 91/32 would be better served if, instead of adding the specified resources to the IPF sub-line, the provisions of the IPF add-on legislation continue for one more year.
Thus, he intends to provide 13 per cent of 1992 project expenditures relating to nationally executed projects approved before 1 January 1992 as an add-on to the IPFs of the countries concerned.

It will be noted that the current estimate of resources necessary to finance the new support cost arrangements amounts to $473 million, which represents a reduction of approximately 25 per cent from the originally established amount of $627 million.
22. Finally, concern has been expressed by the agencies over a slow-down in new project approvals in the fifth programming cycle, the consequent impact on the effective implementation of the new arrangements and the reduction in the flow of support cost resources to the agencies.

The guidelines originally proposed by the Governing Council in decision 91/32, and as modified by decision 92/22, require the provision of a work plan to the Governing Council for information at the session preceding the start of that biennium.
It was the underlying premise of the guidelines that the TSS-1 facility would be used to stimulate and leverage agency regular and other programmes and therefore the timing of the preparation of the former should be synchronized with that of the latter.

28. Based on experience with the formulation of the TSS-1 programme in 1992, it has become evident that the proposed schedule poses several difficulties.
First, it is considered impractical to identify priorities for TSS-1 financing one to two years before the two-year period in which the activities will be implemented, particularly in view of the changing priorities in various developing countries.

Second, it is not considered practical to synchronize and/or otherwise link the TSS-1 programme with the country-specific activities of the agency regular programmes as the latter, at that time of their preparation, do not include such country specificity.

Indeed, the UNDP field offices and agencies have requested that a longer period be provided for the planning and formulation of the work programme for the 1994-1995 biennium, including consultations with the Government and agencies.
29. Taking these factors into consideration, the Administrator has established 30 June 1993 as the deadline for the submission of TSS-1 proposals for the next biennium.

The review, appraisal and selection of proposals will be carried out in July 1993 and the approval completed by September 1993.
The Administrator proposes, therefore, that the finalized work programme be provided to the Council for information at its special session in February 1994.

30. The TSS-2 facility was established by the Governing Council, as stated in decision 91/32 (annex IV), for the purpose of increasing the quality of projects and to assist the Administrator in discharging his accountability by ensuring that technical support is available to all projects, irrespective of the arrangements for the delivery of administrative and operational support services.

The almost exclusive use of TSS-2 for technical backstopping may, at this stage, have limited the overall utilization of the TSS-2 facility.
32. The Administrator has, however, been concerned, in light of the rapid increase in nationally executed projects in recent years, that all measures shall be undertaken to adequately backstop and support such projects with technical support services.

Early indications are that, in some cases, TSS-2 budgets have been approved as a result of this exercise.
In many more cases, however, it was determined that technical support had already been provided in the project budgets and TSS-2 funding was not considered necessary.

For this purpose, UNDP has maintained an ongoing discussion with these agencies on various aspects of the new arrangements.

These agencies are concerned that if this trend were to continues there will be a serious erosion in the capacity of these agencies (which was built up over many years partly in response to the needs of UNDP-financed technical cooperation projects) to continue to provide support to developing countries.
36. It is recognized that the decline in the activities supported by these technical agencies can at least in part be attributed to the six areas of concentration specified by the Governing Council in decision 90/34, which emphasize, in the main, human development and capacity-building.

While these emphases are set in the broader context of the total development effort, and therefore are not inconsistent with nor discourage assistance in the technical areas, in practice it appears that country programmes based on these areas of focus tend to concentrate on the social sectors.

For this purpose, some agencies have indicated an interest in exploring with UNDP the possibility of a modified support cost regime for them which would include these attractive features of the new arrangements while preserving the simplicity of the current arrangements.
They emphasize that any such modified regime should take into account the limited scale but crucial technical character of their activities.

VII. MONITORING AND EVALUATION
40. In paragraph 23 of decision 92/22, the Governing Council took note of the proposal of the Administrator regarding the monitoring and evaluation of national execution and support cost arrangements and requested him to develop detailed performance indicators reflecting the objective of the new arrangements as set out in decision 90/26 of 22 June 1990.

41. It is recognized that monitoring the implementation of the complex set of arrangements which governs the new support cost arrangements should be an ongoing and collaborative activity between the agencies and UNDP.
To this end, UNDP has carried out frequent consultations with agencies on various aspects of the implementation of the new arrangements.

Therefore, monitoring and evaluation of support cost arrangements, while limited to the implementation of these arrangements, should, however, take place in the context of the implementation of the entire package.
42. The performance indicators being developed can be classified under two broad categories and would include both quantitative measures which can be expressed in statistical data and qualitative measures which may not be so expressed.

Mr. Christensen (Denmark), speaking on behalf of those members of the Organizational Committee that were European Union members, said that the institutional donors played an important role in supporting and enhancing the work of the Peacebuilding Commission, and that the Commission would benefit greatly from their maximal involvement both in country-specific meetings and meetings of the Organizational Committee.
He therefore urged the Commission to agree to a model whereby institutional donors were invited on a permanent basis to all meetings.

For that reason, it is important, first and foremost, to ensure that the principle of impartiality is strictly observed in all activities of the Security Council.
Peaceful settlement of conflicts through dialogue and negotiations among the parties concerned should be the main remedy in every case.

Secondly, the Security Council should be reformed as early as possible, given the current rapidly changing world situation.
In that regard, it is important to ensure that non-member States of the Council and other developing countries, which are the overwhelming majority of the United Nations membership, are fully represented.

With regard to expansion of the Security Council, the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea would like to reiterate its consistent position on first enlarging the Council's non-permanent membership, which can be easily agreed, and deferring enlargement of the permanent category of membership to a later stage.

That would be extremely dangerous for the entire United Nations membership.
Last but not least, it is equally important that Security Council reform should encompass measures to ensure transparency in the activities of the Council by opening informal consultations to the public and allowing interested countries, including parties to conflicts, to attend informal meetings.

However, our collective efforts in the Working Group established under General Assembly resolution 48/26 have not borne fruit.
We share the view that reform of the Council must be an integral part of the ongoing reform process of the United Nations and that the reform of the United Nations will remain incomplete without an actual reform of the Council.

The Non-Aligned Movement, which represents the overwhelming number of the membership of the United Nations, has stressed on many occasions that the Council's decision to initiate formal and informal debates on the situation in any Member State or any matter that does not constitute a threat to international peace and security is contrary to Article 24 of the Charter.
Reform of the Council's procedures and working methods must be aimed at promoting transparency and accountability in the Council's treatment of issues of interest to Member States.

What the President did not say, and which might come as a surprise to many of us in this Assembly, is that the first meetings of the Council were in fact held in the open and on record, with reports of the frank exchanges available for all to read.
It is said that there was so much transparency at that first meeting that the representative of the United Kingdom, without realizing that his microphone was switched on, was heard to complain, "That bloody Chairman has double-crossed me again!"

But if there ever is widespread support for going down the path of creating renewable or re-electable seats, that approach would have to be accompanied by measures like a "time-bar" to prevent larger and medium-sized countries from flip-flopping easily between the traditional nonpermanent category and any new, intermediate category, to the detriment of small States.
Singapore sees no reason why any country should have two bites of the cherry.

Can we improve the existing Council structure by reforming both categories of its current composition?

Senegal defends that position, recalling that we cannot talk of equitable representation on the Council without remedying the injustice of Africa being the only continent that does not have a permanent seat on it.
Decision 62/557, adopted on 15 September 2008, offers new prospects that could finally make it possible for us to embark on genuine intergovernmental negotiations.

That is as it should be, because every failure of the Council represents lives lost, peoples uprooted and development being reversed.

As we demand transparency, the Council's functions remain shrouded and opaque.
And as we decolonize the world, our most cherished international function remains the sole province of a virtual five-headed monarchy, largely unchanged in 60 years of global metamorphosis.

That imperative is rooted in the principle of the sovereign equality of States, which underpins the operation of this body.
That equality might be a legal fiction, but the legality of that fiction is enshrined in our Charter and there is no place for Orwellian notions that some States are more equal than others.

To fear the transformative democratic power of the vote or to weigh and rank States' positions by their military and financial might is to debase the foundations upon which this institution stands.
We have as our road map a decision that explicitly divorces the consultative role of the Open-ended Working Group on Security Council Reform from the substantive negotiations to come in the General Assembly plenary.

Thus, the total size of the reformed Security Council would not exceed 25 members.
The amendment to the Charter authorizing the enlargement of the Security Council would also need to include a review clause allowing for a comprehensive review of the new system.

During the period covered in the report, the Council adopted presidential note S/2007/749, which outlined new measures regarding participation in informal consultations of the general membership of the United Nations and of experts, the issuance of the summary statement of issues of which the Council is seized and the preparation of the annual report to the General Assembly.
We applaud the thickness of this year's Security Council report in terms of volume but note that, even with the extra detail, the report is limited to the mere factual presentation of the activities of the Council and its subsidiary bodies.

In order to avoid the Council becoming overstretched in areas which are not within its specific mandate to oversee, the Council should refocus on its core business: the maintenance of international peace and security under Chapters VI and VII of the Charter of the United Nations.
The item on the "Question of equitable representation on and increase in the membership of the Security Council and other matters related to the Security Council" has been on the agenda of the General Assembly since September 1992, though attempts were made as early as 1979 to include it in the agenda.

Our position, which does not favour an expansion of the permanent-member category, should be interpreted not as a rejection of a particular country or group of countries, but rather as a matter of principle based on the general interest of the Organization, which is far greater than the individual interest of any Member State.
With regard to the Council's decision-making mechanisms, it should be recalled that any expansion of the Council's composition will necessarily require that the majority needed to take decisions be adjusted.

Concerning the issue of regional representation, we are convinced of the need to give regional groups a greater role in designating and endorsing their Council candidatures, ensuring appropriate subregional representation in each of them.
We also favour the establishment of mechanisms that would guarantee the representation of transregional groups, such as the League of Arab States and the Organization of the Islamic Conference, including through arrangements among the regional organizations concerned.

Taking note of last August's open debate of the Security Council on its working methods (see S/PV.5968), we support the proposal of Costa Rica, Jordan, Liechtenstein, Singapore and Switzerland -- Small Five States -- aimed at enhancing the accountability, transparency and inclusiveness of the Council's work with a view to strengthening its legitimacy and effectiveness.
We also believe that open debates and interactive briefings by the Security Council are a commendable practice to be further enhanced to the benefit of non-members.

In the San Francisco Conference, the delegation of Uruguay stated that members of the Security Council should enter that body without distinction as to prerogative or rights, while accepting that those countries that had carried the greatest burden in the war be assured seats on the Council but not indefinitely and only for a period that might be judged advisable, say eight or ten years, for example.

The changes to the international scene following the end of the cold war reaffirmed the need to encourage discussions on adapting the United Nations and its bodies, especially the Security Council, to current realities in order to allow them to effectively respond to the challenges of peace, security and development.

We cannot advocate the democratization of international relations or the promotion of democracy in countries while defending the status quo, which excludes and marginalizes the majority of Member States when it comes to taking major decisions.
In a spirit of greater transparency, openness and participation, the Security Council should hold consultations with the countries affected by its decisions.

The annual report of the Security Council before us indicates the many areas all over the world, particularly in Africa, where the Council remains engaged in helping to resolve conflicts.
The Council also stimulated constructive debate on important global issues such as security sector reform, the role of women in peacekeeping operations and the relationship between the Council and regional organizations in terms of Chapter VIII of the Charter.

We should also proceed with the negotiations by clustering issues, as indicated in paragraph (e) (ii) of decision 62/557, and focus on the following five key issues: categories of membership; the question of the veto; regional representation; size of an enlarged Council, and working methods of the Council, as well as the relationship between the Council and the General Assembly.

However, looking at the substance of the issues proposed for discussion, my delegation is concerned that it seems that we again want to rehash and repeat the same consultative discussions the Open-ended Working Group has had over the past 15 years, which unfortunately have not been very helpful in moving the process of the reform forward.
We cannot reopen, renegotiate or amend that decision in any way.

5. Deeper capital markets should provide a conduit for the long-term investment necessary for sustainable development.
Nonetheless, there is a risk that such nascent markets will attract international speculative capital, leading to short-term bubbles, which can reverse when global investor sentiment changes, causing shocks to the real economy.

Globally, 2.5 billion adults do not have access to formal financial services, with the percentage of adults with at least one account at a formal financial institution at around 90 per cent in high-income countries, but only around 57 per cent in upper middle-income countries, 28 per cent in lower middle-income countries and 24 per cent in low-income countries, as of 2012.
Furthermore, it has been suggested that about 200 million small and medium-sized enterprises in developing and emerging markets lack adequate financing.

To achieve sustainable development, policies should link economic and social considerations, along with the mobilization of resources and more efficient public spending, to ensure access to basic economic and social infrastructure.
The Monterrey Consensus stressed the need for raising public resources.

Most OECD countries' tax systems make use of a diverse mix of direct and indirect taxes. Relying on a range of taxes is economically efficient because the marginal cost of collecting any type of tax increases disproportionally after reaching a certain threshold, especially in the context of weak tax administrations.
In many developing countries, tax systems tend to rely on a narrow set of taxes, though those vary depending on geography and resource endowment.

This is in itself a normal part of how a multinational enterprise operates.
If the intracompany price does not reflect the true value, however, profits might effectively be shifted to low-tax or no-tax jurisdictions, while losses and deductions are shifted to high-tax jurisdictions.

For resource-rich countries, transparency in the extractive industries, especially during contract negotiations, is pivotal in ensuring that economic activities by multinational enterprises are taxed appropriately.
Countries should cooperate to ensure that the pressure of multinational enterprises for favourable fiscal regimes for the extractive industries does not turn into a so-called "race to the bottom".

For example, there appears to have been a shift in the composition of FDI from equity to debt components.
As became clear during the financial crisis, when a significant portion of FDI is invested in intracompany debt, the parent company can recall that debt on short notice.

Outward FDI from Asian countries accounts for nearly three quarters of outward FDI from developing countries, primarily driven by outflows from China.
FDI outflows from Africa, however, nearly tripled in 2012, driven by outflows from South Africa.

India, China, the Philippines and Mexico remain the largest recipients of migrant remittances, though smaller developing countries, such as Tajikistan, Liberia, Kyrgyzstan, Lesotho and the Republic of Moldova receive the most as a share of GDP.
The high growth in remittances during the past decade highlights the important role of diaspora communities as providers of a critical source of foreign-exchange earnings.

It is estimated that South-South development cooperation reached between $12.9 billion and $14.8 billion by 2010, and it is expected to grow further, with major increases planned by China, India and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.
Most of the resources come in the form of bilateral programmes of project funding.

This form of cooperation emphasizes common interests and partnership rather than compassion (except in cases of emergency assistance), and embraces a broader concept of development effectiveness.
A distinctive characteristic of South-South development cooperation is an integrated approach that packages commercial transactions in trade, investment and loans with unidirectional support, for example in education, health and infrastructural aid programmes.

53. The need for more predictable international public financing has intensified the search for new sources of development financing, both for financing social needs, particularly in least developed countries, but also for leveraging private financing for climate change and other global concerns.
The World Economic and Social Survey 2012 estimates that around $400 billion to $450 billion per year could be raised through taxes on financial transactions and carbon emissions, and through the use of the special drawing rights of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

These innovative mechanisms are technically feasible means to raise substantial resources in a predictable manner, and could contribute to tackling emerging global challenges; however, they are politically difficult to implement.
The use of special drawing rights in particular faces significant political but also practical and legal hurdles.

Although many low-income countries have benefited from comprehensive debt relief programmes, including the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative, sovereign debt challenges remain in some small States and low-income countries.
57. The problem is most acute among countries in the Caribbean, where extreme weather events exacerbated already weak fiscal positions in some countries.

For example, over the last couple of years, 10 African countries, including 3 low-income countries, have issued sovereign bonds on international capital markets, raising a total of $8.1 billion.
The new debt has a shorter maturity (11.2 years compared with an average maturity of 28.7 years) and higher coupon rate (of 6.2 per cent, compared with an average coupon rate of only 1.6 per cent) on outstanding foreign debt, much of which is concessional.

The disparities had further marginalized already vulnerable groups in society, particularly women who were increasingly numerous in the labour market; in 1996, the overall economic activity rate of women for the age group 20-54 was approaching 70 per cent.

In addition, the reduction of social security measures provided by the State in the new economic environment had exacerbated the economic insecurity of women workers.
Economic globalization was a complex phenomenon and indeed did not only have negative aspects.

A balance needed to be struck between liberalization and social justice, on the understanding that globalization must be subjected to the rules of international law.
That required that the fundamental principles laid down in the Charter of the United Nations must be strictly adhered to by those spearheading globalization.

However, where treaty-based mechanisms were concerned, except for the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, most did not appear to emphasize sufficiently the impact of economic globalization on their respective mandates.
The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights must give leadership in that regard.

The Sub-Commission, established to ensure the protection and promotion of human rights, should be consistent and prevent that private colonization, the sole aim of which was profit.
Globalization would lead to the aggravation of poverty among the poor and widen the gulf between rich and poor, or even cause the disappearance of some populations.

If an organization like WTO held the world's reins, the countries of the third world that wished to participate in exploiting the Earth's resources and sharing in the profits would no longer be able to make themselves heard.
Mr. YOKOTA said that although it was true that all human rights were indivisible and should be treated comprehensively, too much emphasis had been given in the past to "civil and political rights".

He fully endorsed the position of the authors of the report on globalization and its impact on the full enjoyment of all human rights concerning the role of the international economic and financial institutions such as WTO, IMF and the World Bank in the globalization process of economic activities, and particularly their lack of sensitivity to the economic, social and cultural rights of those who lived in poverty.
No attention had hitherto been given to the detrimental consequences of their policies and activities on the peoples of developing countries who were faced with price rises, unemployment and cuts in social welfare as a result of the draconian conditions imposed on them.

For example, in the 1960s the combined assets of the top 200 corporations had accounted for 16 per cent of the world's Gross Domestic Product (GDP), 24 per cent by the early 1980s and 34 per cent in 1995.
In that process not only had the gap between the haves and the have-nots widened but the ranks of the poor were swelling, civil societies were being threatened and Governments were becoming dependent.

Poor countries certainly encountered more difficulties than rich ones, but social inequalities and injustice also existed in rich countries.
Lack of efficiency, poor governance and corruption were likewise not the monopoly of developing countries.

Political rights were indispensable for ensuring the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights but could not genuinely be enjoyed without development and without prosperity.
Mr. YIMER, referring to the demonstrations in Seattle and Washington, which would no doubt be repeated in Prague, said that those reactions revealed the importance of the stakes of globalization at the international level.

As paragraph 7 of the report of the Special Rapporteurs stated, understanding the political and other dimensions of the phenomenon of globalization was essential to the development of a rational and considered response to it.
He considered the issues raised in paragraph 24 of particular importance in that they dealt with the responsibility of the international financial institutions with regard to human rights.

The work of the Working Group on labour methods and the activities of transnational corporations was also useful in that regard.

At future sessions of the Sub-Commission, the Working Group would need to be able to collect testimony from persons whose rights had been adversely affected by the activities of such corporations.
The Sub-Commission should check whether States complied with the obligations incumbent on them concerning the protection of their nationals by means of appropriate legislation to counter the corrupt effects of globalization, namely, physical and economic exploitation, health risks and deterioration of the environment.

Although the majority of developing countries had made poverty alleviation their priority objective, policies of austerity were imposed on Governments by the multilateral institutions leaving them practically no resources for job creation.
Unemployment affected 60 million young people in the world according to ILO and its consequences were the development of national and trans-border criminality, prostitution, drug trafficking and trafficking in human beings.

Recalling Sub-Commission resolution 199/10 and Commission on Human Rights decision 2000/107 on the Social Forum, and realizing that it would not be possible to hold it during the session of the Sub-Commission which had been reduced by a week, she said she intended to submit a draft decision calling for the Social Forum to meet in the form of a presessional working group.
Lastly, she welcomed the work of the Working Group on the working methods and activities of transnational corporations, especially its decision to develop a code of conduct for companies based on international human rights standards.

Globalization was not a temporary phenomenon but a long-term process destined to expand still further.
As Ms. Frey had said, the relations between the State and the actors in the market were changing, but States continued to play a decisive role in international relations by the very fact that they defined international standards and would have the new task of monitoring their implementation by the agents of globalization.

In developing countries, the shortage of drinking water supply systems was a considerable obstacle to the education of girls, who had to go long distances to fetch water and therefore could not attend school.
The right to a healthy environment was threatened by the constant deterioration of the quality of water as a result of pollution and a massive use of pesticides and other chemicals.

The quotation was all the more surprising in that, as Mr. Oloka-Onyango and Ms. Udagama had emphasized in their report, the international financial and trade institutions carried a large share of responsibility for the poverty which burdened many countries.

Those cutbacks had extremely damaging repercussions in such areas as health and education and social welfare generally.
In order to mitigate the adverse effects of globalization it was not enough to resort to emergency measures on behalf of the most vulnerable groups whose very survival was at stake.

It was also necessary to draw up, as ILO had already done, strategies based on job creation.
In their study on globalization, Mr. Oloka Onyango and Ms. Udagama should stress the obligation incumbent on States which implemented structural adjustment programmes to ensure the economic, social and cultural rights of their population and in order to do so regulate their companies' activities without, however, challenging the freedom of their economic exchanges.

The responses of civil society to globalization should also be studied in more depth.
Where the right of access to drinking water was concerned, Mr. Guissé had clearly shown the links between access to drinking water and the fundamental rights - the right to life, to adequate food, to health, to development and to a healthy environment.

However, in the sustainable energy field, external evaluation is more extensive and pronounced than for some of the other Sectoral Committees because of the large extrabudgetary financial resources this programme attracts.

For example, the Energy Efficiency 21 Project webmaster undertook an external evaluation of the Project by an Internet based survey of EE21 participants documented in a report on the EE21 Website Survey.
The survey illustrates how a small but representative sample of EE21 participants view the project and its activities, in particular which activities and facilities of the website are valued most.

The statement put forward by the Croatian representative that "the Security Council on numerous occasions recognized the military involvement of the 'Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro)' in Croatia by, inter alia, linking the sanctions regime imposed against the 'Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro)', to the situation in the areas under Serb control in Croatia" is absolutely untrue and is a cardinal example of a false interpretation of the facts.

In that regard, the State party reiterates the views adopted by the Norwegian Immigration Appeals Board as well as the Norwegian Immigration Authorities, that although the working conditions for journalists and other media representatives in Iran are poor, the complainant had not generated journalistic activities of a nature or scope that could be deemed to draw the continued attention of the authorities, and place him at personal and foreseeable risk.
The State party argues that the journalistic activities conducted by the complainant, even after his arrival in Norway, do not constitute the type of activities that would be subject to monitoring by the Iranian authorities, since the latter are primarily preoccupied with monitoring activities by Iranians in exile that may pose a concrete risk to the regime.

The order stated that there was no objective information to support the claim that the author had suffered ill-treatment during the hours in which she was detained at Civil Guard headquarters under the authority of the National High Court; that none of the three lawyers who had assisted her during her detention had observed any signs of physical ill-treatment, nor had she told them anything about it; and that there was not objective information confirming that such ill-treatment had occurred. It was therefore impossible to establish a causal link with the author's illness.
2.12 The author lodged an application for reconsideration with subsidiary appeal against the order, maintaining that the psychiatric reports were consistent with her statement and were thus prima facie evidence with sufficient substance to continue with proceedings.

Also, it states that none of the lawyers who assisted the author during the course of her detention observed any signs of physical ill-treatment and she herself did not report this, "when it seems logical, in the circumstances, that the victim would have made the ill-treatment known to her lawyer and the investigating judge before whom she appeared; when questioned on the way that she had been treated, she responded only that she had not been hit".
5.2 In the course of the proceedings, a number of inquiries were conducted, in particular medical forensic inquiries.

The order, in setting the case aside, does not affect any civil proceedings to obtain the appropriate indemnification for damage and harm that the author may have suffered.
5.3 In its ruling rejecting the appeal, the Madrid Provincial Court concluded that "there is no evidence to suggest a logical and chronological connection between the particular situation alleged to have taken place on or around 14 June 1996 and the medical assistance provided later at the detention centre where the complainant was admitted, because the prison medical services were not informed until 18 June 1996 of the anxiety suffered on the first date, 14 June 1996, although it came to light as a result of her detention".

With regard to the application for amparo, the Constitutional Court concluded that, in view of the many medical inquiries that had been undertaken, it was not convinced by the arguments put forward by the author regarding the relevance of the evidence that she requested, so it was not included in the Court's final judicial decision.
5.4 Meanwhile, the application to the European Court of Human Rights was deemed inadmissible by the decision of a committee of three judges.

While some of the medical reports lend credibility to the author's version, others contradict it, or at least, indicate that other possibilities cannot be ruled out.
Thus a report by Dr. E.F.R., a psychiatrist at the forensic medical clinic of the Ministry of Justice, produced at the request of investigating judge No. 28, notes that "a causal link between the allegation and the psychologically traumatic experience in question cannot be established, as the information provided by the informant is unsupported by objective data and we are unable to ascertain the truthfulness of this account. ... This post-traumatic stress may be due to multiple life stress factors and this expert cannot, in the light of the available diagnoses, categorically confirm which of them could trigger the alleged post-traumatic stress disorder. ...

These investigations served to prove the existence of a post-traumatic stress disorder.
However, all the action taken, such as the taking of statements from independent lawyers who had assisted the author and from the forensic doctor, did not provide any circumstantial evidence that could justify the continuation of criminal proceedings with the opening of an oral trial.

Although the theory that the author's disorders were a consequence of her detention and pretrial detention was acknowledged, there is reason to think that they are a consequence of the author's procedural situation and her arraignment on a serious criminal charge and not related to irregularities in her detention and pretrial detention.

There is an impartial system of material responsibility in place, which also includes compensation for moral damage and in which it is not necessary to prove that ill-treatment or torture has occurred.
Therefore, the author's claim that it is not possible to obtain indemnification without the prior conviction of those responsible for torture is unfounded.

Such detention may be imposed only in specific cases and in a restrictive manner.
Its application requires legal authorization in all instances on the basis of a substantiated and reasoned decision, which must be issued in the first 24 hours of detention. It also requires constant and direct monitoring of the detainee's personal situation by the judge who approved the detention, or the investigating judge of the judicial district where the detainee is being held.

The only differences from the regular detention regime are: (a) a lawyer is appointed by the court; (b) detainees do not at any time have the right to let family members or anyone else know the reason for their detention or where they are being held in custody; (c) detainees do not have the right to a private interview with the court-appointed lawyer on the conclusion of the inquiry in which they have participated; and (d) the maximum period of detention (72 hours) may be extended by the judge.

The question of duration is not significant in the case of the author, since she was arrested on 7 June and had been brought before a court by 11 June.
5.9 As regards the provision of legal assistance by a court-appointed lawyer rather than by a freely chosen lawyer, the aim is to strike a balance between the prevention of terrorist attacks and the protection of detainees.

With regard to the State party's argument that the author only filed a complaint three years after her release, she states that her counsel sent a letter to the court examining the case against her, in which he detailed her ill-treatment, and that, in the statement that she made before the same court on 7 January 1998, she had confirmed that the contents of that letter were correct.

Furthermore, she points out that one of the medical reports that were submitted confirms that the very pathology unleashed by her experiences may be a sufficient reason to explain why she did not report the incident at the outset.
Her mental state did not allow her to make the great effort required to lodge a complaint.

6.6 Regarding the compensation procedure referred to by the State, set out in article 294 of the Judiciary Organization Act, the Act requires proof that the offence with which an individual was charged was not committed.
However, it is generally impossible to prove a negative, which makes acquittal practically unfeasible.

In a letter dated 13 May 2008, the author was informed that a committee of three judges had decided to declare the action inadmissible, since it did not observe any apparent violation of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention or its Protocols.

The author also maintains that she did not have access to a fair trial after reporting the events, as the judge closed the case without providing the opportunity for an oral trial, on the grounds that there was no objective information to establish that she had suffered ill-treatment.
The State party maintains that the cause of the disorder from which the author suffers was not clearly established by the judicial investigation, in spite of the numerous forensic medical examinations that were carried out, and that the disorder may be a consequence of procedural situation experienced by the author as a result of the action brought against her.

The Committee will therefore examine the facts from that perspective and not under article 10, paragraph 1, which is invoked by the author.

8.5 The Committee observes that, in the course of the investigation by investigating judge No. 28, the Civil Guard officers who had dealt with the author, the court-appointed lawyers provided by the State during her incommunicado detention and the forensic medical examiner who examined her at that time were identified and questioned.
However, the author claims that the Civil Guard officers, in the sole appearance that they made before a judge, refused to answer questions from the private prosecutor.

As for the court-appointed lawyers and the forensic medical examiners, who stated that the author had not complained of ill-treatment, the Committee considers that the reasons given by the author for not informing them of the treatment to which she had been subjected are convincing, especially bearing in mind the vulnerable position in which she found herself as a result of the incommunicado regime.

The Committee also observes that, during the course of the author's trial in the National High Court, the author reported the ill-treatment she had suffered while held incommunicado, but no ex officio investigation was carried out.
8.6 The Committee recalls its general comments No. 20 (1992), and No. 31 (2004) as well as its settled jurisprudence, according to which complaints alleging a violation of article 7 must be investigated promptly, thoroughly and impartially by the competent authorities and appropriate action must be taken against those found guilty.

In the present case, the Committee considers that the closure of the case at the examination stage, which prevented the holding of the oral trial does not meet the requirements or thoroughness that should be applied to all reports of acts of torture, and that the only inquiries conducted at the examination stage were not sufficient to examine the facts with the rigour required by the severity of the author's illness and the reports of the doctors who treated and diagnosed her.
Given the difficulty of proving the existence of torture and ill-treatment when these do not leave physical marks, as in the case of the author, the investigation of such acts should be exhaustive.

Furthermore, all physical or psychological damage inflicted on a person in detention -- and particularly under the incommunicado regime -- gives rise to an important presumption of fact, since the burden of proof must not rest on the presumed victim.

In that connection, it recalls the recommendation issued to the State party on the occasion of the Committee's consideration of the fifth periodic report that it should take the necessary measures, including legislative ones, to definitively put an end to the practice of incommunicado detention and to guarantee that all detainees have the right to freely choose a lawyer who can be consulted in complete confidentiality and who can be present at interrogations.

We are unable to agree with the admissibility decision rendered by the Committee in this case for the following reasons.
The European Court based its inadmissibility decision on the argument that it did not find "any appearance of violation of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention and its Protocols."
We fail to see how this could be interpreted other than as an even limited consideration of the merits.

Indeed, the Committee has found in previous cases that the European Court should be considered as having gone beyond the examination of purely procedural admissibility criteria when declaring an application inadmissible on these grounds.
The author of the communication had the choice between submitting this case either to the European Court of Human Rights or to the Human Rights Committee.

Once she had lodged an application with the European Court of Human Rights alleging a breach of article 3, independently and in relation to article 1 of the European Convention, which was subsequently declared inadmissible for the lack of an apparent violation of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention, the matter has been "examined under another procedure of international investigation" pursuant to the reservation cited above.

It would have been important, however, if the Committee would have highlighted the particular circumstances of the case in more detail. This would have made it clear that the Committee would only deviate from its general respect for reservations such as made by Spain and a substantial number of other European countries and Uganda in exceptional circumstances.

In the present case there is no dispute about the question of whether the communication before the Committee relates to the same matter as the complaint before the European Court of Human Rights.
The main question is whether the European Court of Human Rights had indeed "examined" the case so as to give the reservation its preclusionary effect for purposes of article 5, paragraph 2 (a).

That brings us to the particular circumstances of the present case. The Committee has noted the limited reasoning contained in succinct terms in the letter of the European Court of Human Rights to the author in which she was informed that the Court had declared her application inadmissible since the Court did not observe any apparent violation of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the (European) Convention or its Protocols.
Unfortunately, the Committee leaves it at that and does not further elaborate on the peculiar circumstances of the case.

4. The Committee could have added that in this particular case the letter had been sent by the European Court of Human Rights to the author almost three years after she had submitted her application to the Court without her application having been sent to the State party for its submissions on the admissibility or merits of the case.
The Committee could further have noted that in this particular case the author had lodged her application to the European Court of Human Rights alleging a breach of article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (prohibition of torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment) which is similar to article 7 of the Covenant.

In such cases where the physical integrity, yes indeed the right to life, of the individual complainant has been at stake, it should be clear from the record of the (inadmissibility) decision of the European Court of Human Rights that the Court has sufficiently given attention to the merits of the case in order to constitute an examination for purposes of the preclusionary effect of a reservation, like the Spanish one, to article 5, paragraph 2 (a), of the Optional Protocol.

However, Batwa women in Burundi are still discriminated against and marginalized, because they are not included in the 30 per cent quota for decision-making institutions in Burundi or in the life of the country.
Yet articles 13 and 14 of the Constitution of Burundi encourage everyone without discrimination to participate in decision-making.

5.2. Issuing of IDPs - Standardization and Harmonization of Types
The conditions for the issuing and the models of IDPs laid down by the 1949 and 1968 Conventions are different for each of the two Conventions; this results in confusion being created between the two models and in difficulties in implementing the provisions of the Convention.
